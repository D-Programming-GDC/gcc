/* SLP Pattern matching mechanism.

  This extension to the SLP vectorizer allows one to transform the generated SLP
  tree based on any pattern.  The difference between this and the normal vect
  pattern matcher is that unlike the former, this matcher allows you to match
  with instructions that do not belong to the same SSA dominator graph.

  The only requirement that this pattern matcher has is that you are only
  only allowed to either match an entire group or none.

  The pattern matcher currently only allows you to perform replacements to
  internal functions.

  Once the patterns are matched it is one way, these cannot be undone.  It is
  currently not supported to match patterns recursively.

  To add a new pattern, implement the vect_pattern class and add the type to
  slp_patterns.

  The pattern matcher allows you to replace both statements 0 and 1 or none at
  all.  Because this operation is a two operands operation the actual nodes
  being replaced are those in the { } nodes.  The actual scalar statements
  themselves are not replaced or used during the matching but instead the
  SLP_TREE_REPRESENTATIVE statements are inspected.  You are also allowed to
  replace and match on any number of nodes.

  Because the pattern matcher matches on the representative statement for the
  SLP node the case of two_operators it allows you to match the children of the
  node.  This is done using the method `recognize ()`.
