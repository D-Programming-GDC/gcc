.. _The_File_Cleanup_Utility_gnatclean:

The File Cleanup Utility ``gnatclean``
======================================

.. index:: File cleanup tool
.. index:: gnatclean

``gnatclean`` is a tool that allows the deletion of files produced by the
compiler, binder and linker, including ALI files, object files, tree files,
expanded source files, library files, interface copy source files, binder
generated files and executable files.

.. _Running_gnatclean:

Running ``gnatclean``
---------------------

The ``gnatclean`` command has the form:

  ::

      $ gnatclean switches names

where ``names`` is a list of source file names. Suffixes :file:`.ads` and
:file:`adb` may be omitted. If a project file is specified using switch
:switch:`-P`, then ``names`` may be completely omitted.

In normal mode, ``gnatclean`` delete the files produced by the compiler and,
if switch :switch:`-c` is not specified, by the binder and
the linker. In informative-only mode, specified by switch
:switch:`-n`, the list of files that would have been deleted in
normal mode is listed, but no file is actually deleted.


.. _Switches_for_gnatclean:

Switches for ``gnatclean``
--------------------------

``gnatclean`` recognizes the following switches:

.. index:: --version (gnatclean)

:switch:`--version`
  Display copyright and version, then exit disregarding all other options.

.. index:: --help (gnatclean)

:switch:`--help`
  If :switch:`--version` was not used, display usage, then exit disregarding
  all other options.

:switch:`--subdirs={subdir}`
  Actual object directory of each project file is the subdirectory subdir of the
  object directory specified or defaulted in the project file.

:switch:`--unchecked-shared-lib-imports`
  By default, shared library projects are not allowed to import static library
  projects. When this switch is used on the command line, this restriction is
  relaxed.

.. index:: -c (gnatclean)

:switch:`-c`
  Only attempt to delete the files produced by the compiler, not those produced
  by the binder or the linker. The files that are not to be deleted are library
  files, interface copy files, binder generated files and executable files.

.. index:: -D (gnatclean)

:switch:`-D {dir}`
  Indicate that ALI and object files should normally be found in directory ``dir``.

.. index:: -F (gnatclean)

:switch:`-F`
  When using project files, if some errors or warnings are detected during
  parsing and verbose mode is not in effect (no use of switch
  -v), then error lines start with the full path name of the project
  file, rather than its simple file name.

.. index:: -h (gnatclean)

:switch:`-h`
  Output a message explaining the usage of ``gnatclean``.

.. index:: -n (gnatclean)

:switch:`-n`
  Informative-only mode. Do not delete any files. Output the list of the files
  that would have been deleted if this switch was not specified.

.. index:: -P (gnatclean)

:switch:`-P{project}`
  Use project file ``project``. Only one such switch can be used.
  When cleaning a project file, the files produced by the compilation of the
  immediate sources or inherited sources of the project files are to be
  deleted. This is not depending on the presence or not of executable names
  on the command line.

.. index:: -q (gnatclean)

:switch:`-q`
  Quiet output. If there are no errors, do not output anything, except in
  verbose mode (switch -v) or in informative-only mode
  (switch -n).

.. index:: -r (gnatclean)

:switch:`-r`
  When a project file is specified (using switch -P),
  clean all imported and extended project files, recursively. If this switch
  is not specified, only the files related to the main project file are to be
  deleted. This switch has no effect if no project file is specified.

.. index:: -v (gnatclean)

:switch:`-v`
  Verbose mode.

.. index:: -vP (gnatclean)

:switch:`-vP{x}`
  Indicates the verbosity of the parsing of GNAT project files.
  :ref:`Switches_Related_to_Project_Files`.

.. index:: -X (gnatclean)

:switch:`-X{name}={value}`
  Indicates that external variable ``name`` has the value ``value``.
  The Project Manager will use this value for occurrences of
  ``external(name)`` when parsing the project file.
  See :ref:`Switches_Related_to_Project_Files`.

.. index:: -aO (gnatclean)

:switch:`-aO{dir}`
  When searching for ALI and object files, look in directory ``dir``.

.. index:: -I (gnatclean)

:switch:`-I{dir}`
  Equivalent to :switch:`-aO{dir}`.

.. index:: -I- (gnatclean)

.. index:: Source files, suppressing search

:switch:`-I-`
  Do not look for ALI or object files in the directory
  where ``gnatclean`` was invoked.



.. _The_GNAT_Library_Browser_gnatls:

The GNAT Library Browser ``gnatls``
===================================

.. index:: Library browser
.. index:: ! gnatls

``gnatls`` is a tool that outputs information about compiled
units. It gives the relationship between objects, unit names and source
files. It can also be used to check the source dependencies of a unit
as well as various characteristics.

.. _Running_gnatls:

Running ``gnatls``
------------------

The ``gnatls`` command has the form

  ::

      $ gnatls switches object_or_ali_file

The main argument is the list of object or :file:`ali` files
(see :ref:`The_Ada_Library_Information_Files`)
for which information is requested.

In normal mode, without additional option, ``gnatls`` produces a
four-column listing. Each line represents information for a specific
object. The first column gives the full path of the object, the second
column gives the name of the principal unit in this object, the third
column gives the status of the source and the fourth column gives the
full path of the source representing this unit.
Here is a simple example of use:


  ::

     $ gnatls *.o
     ./demo1.o            demo1            DIF demo1.adb
     ./demo2.o            demo2             OK demo2.adb
     ./hello.o            h1                OK hello.adb
     ./instr-child.o      instr.child      MOK instr-child.adb
     ./instr.o            instr             OK instr.adb
     ./tef.o              tef              DIF tef.adb
     ./text_io_example.o  text_io_example   OK text_io_example.adb
     ./tgef.o             tgef             DIF tgef.adb

The first line can be interpreted as follows: the main unit which is
contained in
object file :file:`demo1.o` is demo1, whose main source is in
:file:`demo1.adb`. Furthermore, the version of the source used for the
compilation of demo1 has been modified (DIF). Each source file has a status
qualifier which can be:

*OK (unchanged)*
  The version of the source file used for the compilation of the
  specified unit corresponds exactly to the actual source file.

*MOK (slightly modified)*
  The version of the source file used for the compilation of the
  specified unit differs from the actual source file but not enough to
  require recompilation. If you use gnatmake with the option
  :switch:`-m` (minimal recompilation), a file marked
  MOK will not be recompiled.

*DIF (modified)*
  No version of the source found on the path corresponds to the source
  used to build this object.

*??? (file not found)*
  No source file was found for this unit.

*HID (hidden,  unchanged version not first on PATH)*
  The version of the source that corresponds exactly to the source used
  for compilation has been found on the path but it is hidden by another
  version of the same source that has been modified.


.. _Switches_for_gnatls:

Switches for ``gnatls``
-----------------------

``gnatls`` recognizes the following switches:


.. index:: --version (gnatls)

:switch:`--version`
  Display copyright and version, then exit disregarding all other options.


.. index:: --help (gnatls)

:switch:`--help`
  If :switch:`--version` was not used, display usage, then exit disregarding
  all other options.


.. index:: -a (gnatls)

:switch:`-a`
  Consider all units, including those of the predefined Ada library.
  Especially useful with :switch:`-d`.


.. index:: -d (gnatls)

:switch:`-d`
  List sources from which specified units depend on.


.. index:: -h (gnatls)

:switch:`-h`
  Output the list of options.


.. index:: -o (gnatls)

:switch:`-o`
  Only output information about object files.


.. index:: -s (gnatls)

:switch:`-s`
  Only output information about source files.


.. index:: -u (gnatls)

:switch:`-u`
  Only output information about compilation units.


.. index:: -files (gnatls)

:switch:`-files={file}`
  Take as arguments the files listed in text file ``file``.
  Text file ``file`` may contain empty lines that are ignored.
  Each nonempty line should contain the name of an existing file.
  Several such switches may be specified simultaneously.


.. index:: -aO (gnatls)

.. index:: -aI (gnatls)

.. index:: -I (gnatls)

.. index:: -I- (gnatls)

:switch:`-aO{dir}`, :switch:`-aI{dir}`, :switch:`-I{dir}`, :switch:`-I-`, :switch:`-nostdinc`
  Source path manipulation. Same meaning as the equivalent ``gnatmake``
  flags (:ref:`Switches_for_gnatmake`).


.. index:: -aP (gnatls)

:switch:`-aP{dir}`
  Add ``dir`` at the beginning of the project search dir.


.. index:: --RTS (gnatls)

:switch:`--RTS={rts-path}`
  Specifies the default location of the runtime library. Same meaning as the
  equivalent ``gnatmake`` flag (:ref:`Switches_for_gnatmake`).


.. index:: -v (gnatls)

:switch:`-v`
  Verbose mode. Output the complete source, object and project paths. Do not use
  the default column layout but instead use long format giving as much as
  information possible on each requested units, including special
  characteristics such as:

  * *Preelaborable*: The unit is preelaborable in the Ada sense.

  * *No_Elab_Code*:  No elaboration code has been produced by the compiler for this unit.

  * *Pure*: The unit is pure in the Ada sense.

  * *Elaborate_Body*: The unit contains a pragma Elaborate_Body.

  * *Remote_Types*: The unit contains a pragma Remote_Types.

  * *Shared_Passive*: The unit contains a pragma Shared_Passive.

  * *Predefined*: This unit is part of the predefined environment and cannot be modified
    by the user.

  * *Remote_Call_Interface*: The unit contains a pragma Remote_Call_Interface.

  .. _The_Coding_Standard_Verifier_gnatcheck:

  The Coding Standard Verifier ``gnatcheck``
  ==========================================

  .. index:: ! gnatcheck
  .. index:: ASIS

  The ``gnatcheck`` tool is an ASIS-based utility that checks coding standard
  compliance of Ada source files according to a given set of semantic rules.

  ``gnatcheck`` is a project-aware tool
  (see :ref:`Using_Project_Files_with_GNAT_Tools` for a description of
  the project-related switches). The project file package that can specify
  ``gnatcheck`` switches is named ``Check``.

  For full details, plese refer to :title:`GNATcheck Reference Manual`.



.. only:: PRO or GPL

  .. _The_GNAT_Metrics_Tool_gnatmetric:

  The GNAT Metrics Tool ``gnatmetric``
  ====================================

  .. index:: ! gnatmetric
  .. index:: Metric tool

  The ``gnatmetric`` tool is a utility
  for computing various program metrics.
  It takes an Ada source file as input and generates a file containing the
  metrics data as output. Various switches control which
  metrics are reported.

  ``gnatmetric`` is a project-aware tool
  (see :ref:`Using_Project_Files_with_GNAT_Tools` for a description of
  the project-related switches). The project file package that can specify
  ``gnatmetric`` switches is named ``Metrics``.

  The ``gnatmetric`` command has the form

    ::

       $ gnatmetric [ switches ] { filename }

  where:

  * ``switches`` specify the metrics to compute and define the destination for
    the output

  * Each ``filename`` is the name of a source file to process. 'Wildcards' are
    allowed, and the file name may contain path information.  If no
    ``filename`` is supplied, then the ``switches`` list must contain at least
    one :switch:`--files` switch (see :ref:`Other_gnatmetric_Switches`).
    Including both a :switch:`--files` switch and one or more ``filename``
    arguments is permitted.

    Note that it is no longer necessary to specify the Ada language version;
    ``gnatmetric`` can process Ada source code written in any version from
    Ada 83 onward without specifying any language version switch.

  The following subsections describe the various switches accepted by
  ``gnatmetric``, organized by category.

  .. _Output_File_Control-gnatmetric:

  Output File Control
  -------------------

  .. index:: Output file control in gnatmetric

  ``gnatmetric`` has two output formats. It can generate a
  textual (human-readable) form, and also XML. By default only textual
  output is generated.

  When generating the output in textual form, ``gnatmetric`` creates
  for each Ada source file a corresponding text file
  containing the computed metrics, except for the case when the set of metrics
  specified by gnatmetric parameters consists only of metrics that are computed
  for the whole set of analyzed sources, but not for each Ada source.
  By default, the name of the file containing metric information for a source
  is obtained by appending the :file:`.metrix` suffix to the
  name of the input source file. If not otherwise specified and no project file
  is specified as ``gnatmetric`` option this file is placed in the same
  directory as where the source file is located. If ``gnatmetric`` has a
  project  file as its parameter, it places all the generated files in the
  object directory of the project (or in the project source directory if the
  project does not define an object directory). If :switch:`--subdirs` option
  is specified, the files are placed in the subrirectory of this directory
  specified by this option.

  All the output information generated in XML format is placed in a single
  file. By default the name of this file is :file:`metrix.xml`.
  If not otherwise specified and if no project file is specified
  as ``gnatmetric`` option this file is placed in the
  current directory.

  Some of the computed metrics are summed over the units passed to
  ``gnatmetric``; for example, the total number of lines of code.
  By default this information is sent to :file:`stdout`, but a file
  can be specified with the :switch:`--global-file-name` switch.

  The following switches control the ``gnatmetric`` output:

  .. index:: --generate-xml-output (gnatmetric)

  :switch:`--generate-xml-output`
    Generate XML output.

  .. index:: --generate-xml-schema (gnatmetric)

  :switch:`--generate-xml-schema`
    Generate XML output and an XML schema file that describes the structure
    of the XML metric report. This schema is assigned to the XML file. The schema
    file has the same name as the XML output file with :file:`.xml` suffix replaced
    with :file:`.xsd`.

  .. index:: --no-text-output (gnatmetric)


  :switch:`--no-text-output`
    Do not generate the output in text form (implies :switch:`-x`).

  .. index:: --output-dir (gnatmetric)


  :switch:`--output-dir={output_dir}`
    Put text files with detailed metrics into ``output_dir``.

  .. index:: --output-suffix (gnatmetric)


  :switch:`--output-suffix={file_suffix}`
    Use ``file_suffix``, instead of :file:`.metrix`
    in the name of the output file.

  .. index:: --global-file-name (gnatmetric)

  :switch:`--global-file-name={file_name}`
    Put global metrics into ``file_name``.

  .. index:: --xml-file-name (gnatmetric)


  :switch:`--xml-file-name={file_name}`
    Put the XML output into ``file_name``
    (also implies :switch:`--generate-xml-output`).

  .. index:: --short-file-names (gnatmetric)

  :switch:`--short-file-names`
    Use 'short' source file names in the output. (The ``gnatmetric``
    output includes the name(s) of the Ada source file(s) from which the
    metrics are computed. By default each name includes the absolute
    path. The :switch:`--short-file-names` switch causes ``gnatmetric``
    to exclude all directory information from the file names that are
    output.)

   .. index:: --wide-character-encoding (gnatmetric)

   :switch:`--wide-character-encoding={e}`
     Specify the wide character encoding method for the input and output
     files. ``e`` is one of the following:

     * *8* - UTF-8 encoding

     * *b* - Brackets encoding (default value)


  .. index:: Disable Metrics For Local Units in gnatmetric

  .. _Disable_Metrics_For_Local_Units:

  Disable Metrics For Local Units
  -------------------------------

  ``gnatmetric`` relies on the GNAT compilation model --
  one compilation
  unit per one source file. It computes line metrics for the whole source
  file, and it also computes syntax
  and complexity metrics for the file's outermost unit.

  By default, ``gnatmetric`` will also compute all metrics for certain
  kinds of locally declared program units:

  * subprogram (and generic subprogram) bodies;

  * package (and generic package) specs and bodies;

  * task object and type specifications and bodies;

  * protected object and type specifications and bodies.

  .. index:: Eligible local unit (for gnatmetric)

  These kinds of entities will be referred to as
  *eligible local program units*, or simply *eligible local units*,
  in the discussion below.

  Note that a subprogram declaration, generic instantiation,
  or renaming declaration only receives metrics
  computation when it appear as the outermost entity
  in a source file.

  Suppression of metrics computation for eligible local units can be
  obtained via the following switch:


  .. index:: --no-local-metrics (gnatmetric)


  :switch:`--no-local-metrics`
    Do not compute detailed metrics for eligible local program units.


  .. _Specifying_a_set_of_metrics_to_compute:

  Specifying a set of metrics to compute
  --------------------------------------

  By default all the metrics are reported. The switches described in this
  subsection allow you to control, on an individual basis, whether metrics are
  reported. If at least one positive metric switch is specified (that is, a
  switch that defines that a given metric or set of metrics is to be computed),
  then only explicitly specified metrics are reported.

  .. _Line_Metrics_Control:

  Line Metrics Control
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  .. index:: Line metrics control in gnatmetric

  For each source file, and for each of its eligible local program
  units, ``gnatmetric`` computes the following metrics:

  * the total number of lines;

  * the total number of code lines (i.e., non-blank lines that are not
    comments)

  * the number of comment lines

  * the number of code lines containing end-of-line comments;

  * the comment percentage: the ratio between the number of lines that
    contain comments and the number of all non-blank lines, expressed as
    a percentage

  * the number of empty lines and lines containing only space characters
    and/or format effectors (blank lines)

  * the average number of code lines in subprogram bodies, task bodies,
    entry bodies and statement sequences in package bodies

  ``gnatmetric`` sums the values of the line metrics for all the files
  being processed and then generates the cumulative results. The tool
  also computes for all the files being processed the average number of
  code lines in bodies.

  You can use the following switches to select the specific line metrics
  to be reported.


  .. index:: --lines (gnatmetric)
  .. index:: --no-lines (gnatmetric)


  :switch:`--lines-all`
    Report all the line metrics


  :switch:`--no-lines-all`
    Do not report any of line metrics


  :switch:`--lines`
    Report the number of all lines


  :switch:`--no-lines`
    Do not report the number of all lines


  :switch:`--lines-code`
    Report the number of code lines


  :switch:`--no-lines-code`
    Do not report the number of code lines


  :switch:`--lines-comment`
    Report the number of comment lines


  :switch:`--no-lines-comment`
    Do not report the number of comment lines


  :switch:`--lines-eol-comment`
    Report the number of code lines containing
    end-of-line comments


  :switch:`--no-lines-eol-comment`
    Do not report the number of code lines containing
    end-of-line comments


  :switch:`--lines-ratio`
    Report the comment percentage in the program text


  :switch:`--no-lines-ratio`
    Do not report the comment percentage in the program text


  :switch:`--lines-blank`
    Report the number of blank lines


  :switch:`--no-lines-blank`
    Do not report the number of blank lines


  :switch:`--lines-average`
    Report the average number of code lines in subprogram bodies, task bodies,
    entry bodies and statement sequences in package bodies.


  :switch:`--no-lines-average`
    Do not report the average number of code lines in subprogram bodies,
    task bodies, entry bodies and statement sequences in package bodies.


  :switch:`--lines-spark`
    Report the number of lines written in SPARK.


  :switch:`--no-lines-spark`
    Do not report the number of lines written in SPARK.


  .. _Syntax_Metrics_Control:

  Syntax Metrics Control
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  .. index:: Syntax metrics control in gnatmetric

  ``gnatmetric`` computes various syntactic metrics for the
  outermost unit and for each eligible local unit:

  * *LSLOC ('Logical Source Lines Of Code')*
      The total number of declarations and the total number of
      statements. Note that the definition of declarations is the one
      given in the reference manual:

        "Each of the following is defined to be a declaration: any
        basic_declaration; an enumeration_literal_specification; a
        discriminant_specification; a component_declaration; a
        loop_parameter_specification; a parameter_specification; a
        subprogram_body; an entry_declaration; an
        entry_index_specification; a choice_parameter_specification; a
        generic_formal_parameter_declaration."

      This means for example that each enumeration literal adds one to
      the count, as well as each subprogram parameter.

  * *Maximal static nesting level of inner program units*
      According to :title:`Ada Reference Manual`, 10.1(1):

        "A program unit is either a package, a task unit, a protected
        unit, a protected entry, a generic unit, or an explicitly
        declared subprogram other than an enumeration literal."

  * *Maximal nesting level of composite syntactic constructs*
      This corresponds to the notion of the maximum nesting level in the
      GNAT built-in style checks (see :ref:`Style_Checking`).

  * *Number of formal parameters*
      Number of formal parameters of a subprogram; if a subprogram does
      have parameters, then numbers of "in", "out" and "in out"
      parameters are also reported. This metric is reported for
      subprogram specifications and for subprogram instantiations. For
      subprogram bodies, expression functions and null procedures this
      metric is reported if the construct acts as a subprogram
      declaration but is not a completion of previous declaration. This
      metric is not reported for generic and formal subprograms.

  For the outermost unit in the file, ``gnatmetric`` additionally
  computes the following metrics:

  * *Public subprograms*
      This metric is computed for package specs. It is the number of
      subprograms and generic subprograms declared in the visible part
      (including the visible part of nested packages, protected objects,
      and protected types).


  * *All subprograms*
      This metric is computed for bodies and subunits. The metric is
      equal to a total number of subprogram bodies in the compilation
      unit.
      Neither generic instantiations nor renamings-as-a-body nor body
      stubs are counted. Any subprogram body is counted, independently
      of its nesting level and enclosing constructs. Generic bodies and
      bodies of protected subprograms are counted in the same way as
      'usual' subprogram bodies.


  * *Public types*
      This metric is computed for package specs and generic package
      declarations. It is the total number of types that can be
      referenced from outside this compilation unit, plus the number of
      types from all the visible parts of all the visible generic
      packages. Generic formal types are not counted. Only types, not
      subtypes, are included.

      Along with the total number of public types, the following
      types are counted and reported separately:

      * *Abstract types*

      * *Root tagged types^ (abstract, non-abstract, private,
        non-private). Type extensions are *not* counted

      * *Private types* (including private extensions)

      * *Task types*

      * *Protected types*

  * *All types*
      This metric is computed for any compilation unit. It is equal to
      the total number of the declarations of different types given in
      the compilation unit. The private and the corresponding full type
      declaration are counted as one type declaration. Incomplete type
      declarations and generic formal types are not counted.
      No distinction is made among different kinds of types (abstract,
      private etc.); the total number of types is reported.

  By default, all the syntax metrics are reported. You can use the following
  switches to select specific syntax metrics.

  .. _Complexity_Metrics_Control:

  Complexity Metrics Control
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  .. index:: Complexity metrics control in gnatmetric

  For a program unit that is an executable body (a subprogram body
  (including generic bodies), task body, entry body or a package body
  containing its own statement sequence) ``gnatmetric`` computes the
  following complexity metrics:

  * McCabe cyclomatic complexity;

  * McCabe essential complexity;

  * maximal loop nesting level;

  * extra exit points (for subprograms);

  The McCabe cyclomatic complexity metric is defined
  in `http://www.mccabe.com/pdf/mccabe-nist235r.pdf <http://www.mccabe.com/pdf/mccabe-nist235r.pdf>`_

  According to McCabe, both control statements and short-circuit control
  forms should be taken into account when computing cyclomatic
  complexity. For Ada 2012 we have also take into account conditional
  expressions and quantified expressions. For each body, we compute
  three metric values:

  * the complexity introduced by control
    statements only, without taking into account short-circuit forms
    (referred as ``statement complexity`` in ``gnatmetric`` output),

  * the complexity introduced by short-circuit control forms only
    (referred as ``expression complexity`` in ``gnatmetric`` output),
    and

  * the total
    cyclomatic complexity, which is the sum of these two values
    (referred as ``cyclomatic complexity`` in ``gnatmetric`` output).

  The cyclomatic complexity is also computed for Ada 2012 expression functions.
  An expression function cannot have statements as its components, so only one
  metric value is computed as a cyclomatic complexity of an expression function.

  The origin of cyclomatic complexity metric is the need to estimate the number
  of independent paths in the control flow graph that in turn gives the number
  of tests needed to satisfy paths coverage testing completeness criterion.
  Considered from the testing point of view, a static Ada ``loop`` (that is,
  the ``loop`` statement having static subtype in loop parameter
  specification) does not add to cyclomatic complexity. By providing
  :switch:`--no-static-loop` option a user
  may specify that such loops should not be counted when computing the
  cyclomatic complexity metric

  The Ada essential complexity metric is a McCabe cyclomatic complexity metric
  counted for the code that is reduced by excluding all the pure structural Ada
  control statements. An compound statement is considered as a non-structural
  if it contains a ``raise`` or ``return`` statement as it subcomponent,
  or if it contains a ``goto`` statement that transfers the control outside
  the operator. A selective ``accept`` statement with a ``terminate`` alternative
  is considered a non-structural statement. When computing this metric,
  ``exit`` statements are treated in the same way as ``goto``
  statements unless the :switch:`-ne` option is specified.

  The Ada essential complexity metric defined here is intended to quantify
  the extent to which the software is unstructured. It is adapted from
  the McCabe essential complexity metric defined in
  http://www.mccabe.com/pdf/mccabe-nist235r.pdf
  but is modified to be more
  suitable for typical Ada usage. For example, short circuit forms
  are not penalized as unstructured in the Ada essential complexity metric.

  When computing cyclomatic and essential complexity, ``gnatmetric`` skips
  the code in the exception handlers and in all the nested program units. The
  code of assertions and predicates (that is, subprogram preconditions and
  postconditions, subtype predicates and type invariants) is also skipped.

  By default, all the complexity metrics are reported. For more fine-grained
  control you can use the following switches:


  .. index:: --complexity (gnatmetric)
  .. index:: --no-complexity (gnatmetric)


  :switch:`--complexity-all`
    Report all the complexity metrics


  :switch:`--no-complexity-all`
    Do not report any of the complexity metrics


  :switch:`--complexity-cyclomatic`
    Report the McCabe Cyclomatic Complexity


  :switch:`--no-complexity-cyclomatic`
    Do not report the McCabe Cyclomatic Complexity


  :switch:`--complexity-essential`
    Report the Essential Complexity


  :switch:`--no-complexity-essential`
    Do not report the Essential Complexity


  :switch:`--loop-nesting`
    Report maximal loop nesting level


  :switch:`-no-loop-nesting`
    Do not report maximal loop nesting level


  :switch:`--complexity-average`
    Report the average McCabe Cyclomatic Complexity for all the subprogram bodies,
    task bodies, entry bodies and statement sequences in package bodies.
    The metric is reported for whole set of processed Ada sources only.


  :switch:`--no-complexity-average`
    Do not report the average McCabe Cyclomatic Complexity for all the subprogram
    bodies, task bodies, entry bodies and statement sequences in package bodies

  .. index:: --no-treat-exit-as-goto (gnatmetric)


  :switch:`--no-treat-exit-as-goto`
    Do not consider ``exit`` statements as ``goto``\ s when
    computing Essential Complexity

  .. index:: --no-static-loop (gnatmetric)


  :switch:`--no-static-loop`
    Do not consider static loops when computing cyclomatic complexity


  :switch:`--extra-exit-points`
    Report the extra exit points for subprogram bodies. As an exit point, this
    metric counts ``return`` statements and raise statements in case when the
    raised exception is not handled in the same body. In case of a function this
    metric subtracts 1 from the number of exit points, because a function body
    must contain at least one ``return`` statement.


  :switch:`--no-extra-exit-points`
    Do not report the extra exit points for subprogram bodies


  .. _Coupling_Metrics_Control:

  Coupling Metrics Control
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  .. index:: Coupling metrics control in gnatmetric

  .. index:: Coupling metrics (in gnatmetric)

  Coupling metrics measure the dependencies between a given entity and other
  entities in the program. This information is useful since high coupling
  may signal potential issues with maintainability as the program evolves.

  ``gnatmetric`` computes the following coupling metrics:


  * *object-oriented coupling*, for classes in traditional object-oriented
    sense;

  * *unit coupling*, for all the program units making up a program;

  * *control coupling*, reflecting dependencies between a unit and
    other units that contain subprograms.

  .. index:: fan-out coupling
  .. index:: efferent coupling

  Two kinds of coupling metrics are computed:

  * fan-out coupling ('efferent coupling'):
    the number of entities the given entity depends upon. This metric
    reflects how the given entity depends on the changes in the
    'external world'.

  .. index:: fan-in coupling
  .. index:: afferent coupling

  * fan-in coupling ('afferent' coupling):
    the number of entities that depend on a given entity.
    This metric reflects how the 'external world' depends on the changes in a
    given entity.

  Object-oriented coupling metrics measure the dependencies
  between a given class (or a group of classes) and the other classes in the
  program. In this subsection the term 'class' is used in its traditional
  object-oriented programming sense (an instantiable module that contains data
  and/or method members). A *category* (of classes) is a group of closely
  related classes that are reused and/or modified together.

  A class ``K``\ 's fan-out coupling is the number of classes
  that ``K`` depends upon.
  A category's fan-out coupling is the number of classes outside the
  category that the classes inside the category depend upon.

  A class ``K``\ 's fan-in coupling is the number of classes
  that depend upon ``K``.
  A category's fan-in coupling is the number of classes outside the
  category that depend on classes belonging to the category.

  Ada's object-oriented paradigm separates the instantiable entity
  (type) from the module (package), so the definition of the coupling
  metrics for Ada maps the class and class category notions
  onto Ada constructs.

  For the coupling metrics, several kinds of modules that define a tagged type
  or an interface type  -- library packages, library generic packages, and
  library generic package instantiations -- are considered to be classes.
  A category consists of a library package (or
  a library generic package) that defines a tagged or an interface type,
  together with all its descendant (generic) packages that define tagged
  or interface types. Thus a
  category is an Ada hierarchy of library-level program units. Class
  coupling in Ada is referred to as 'tagged coupling', and category coupling
  is referred to as 'hierarchy coupling'.

  For any package serving as a class, its body and subunits (if any) are
  considered together with its spec when computing dependencies, and coupling
  metrics are reported for spec units only. Dependencies between classes
  mean Ada semantic dependencies. For object-oriented coupling
  metrics, only dependencies on units treated as classes are
  considered.

  Similarly, for unit and control coupling an entity is considered to be the
  conceptual construct consisting of the entity's specification, body, and
  any subunits (transitively).
  ``gnatmetric`` computes
  the dependencies of all these units as a whole, but
  metrics are only reported for spec
  units (or for a subprogram body unit in case if there is no
  separate spec for the given subprogram).

  For unit coupling, dependencies are computed between all kinds of program
  units. For control coupling, the dependencies of a given unit are limited to
  those units that define subprograms. Thus control fan-out coupling is reported
  for all units, but control fan-in coupling is only reported for units
  that define subprograms.

  The following simple example illustrates the difference between unit coupling
  and control coupling metrics:

    .. code-block:: ada

         package Lib_1 is
             function F_1 (I : Integer) return Integer;
         end Lib_1;

         package Lib_2 is
             type T_2 is new Integer;
         end Lib_2;

         package body Lib_1 is
             function F_1 (I : Integer) return Integer is
             begin
                return I + 1;
             end F_1;
         end Lib_1;

         with Lib_2; use Lib_2;
         package Pack is
             Var : T_2;
             function Fun (I : Integer) return Integer;
         end Pack;

         with Lib_1; use Lib_1;
         package body Pack is
             function Fun (I : Integer) return Integer is
             begin
                return F_1 (I);
             end Fun;
         end Pack;

  If we apply ``gnatmetric`` with the :switch:`--coupling-all` option to
  these units, the result will be:

    ::

       Coupling metrics:
       =================
           Unit Lib_1 (C:\\customers\\662\\L406-007\\lib_1.ads)
              control fan-out coupling  : 0
              control fan-in coupling   : 1
              unit fan-out coupling     : 0
              unit fan-in coupling      : 1

           Unit Pack (C:\\customers\\662\\L406-007\\pack.ads)
              control fan-out coupling  : 1
              control fan-in coupling   : 0
              unit fan-out coupling     : 2
              unit fan-in coupling      : 0

           Unit Lib_2 (C:\\customers\\662\\L406-007\\lib_2.ads)
              control fan-out coupling  : 0
              unit fan-out coupling     : 0
              unit fan-in coupling      : 1

  The result does not contain values for object-oriented
  coupling because none of the argument units contains a tagged type and
  therefore none of these units can be treated as a class.

  The ``Pack`` package (spec and body) depends on two
  units -- ``Lib_1`` and ``Lib_2`` -- and so its unit fan-out coupling
  is 2. Since nothing depends on it, its unit fan-in coupling is 0, as
  is its control fan-in coupling. Only one of the units ``Pack`` depends
  upon defines a subprogram, so its control fan-out coupling is 1.

  ``Lib_2`` depends on nothing, so its fan-out metrics are 0. It does
  not define any subprograms, so it has no control fan-in metric.
  One unit (``Pack``) depends on it , so its unit fan-in coupling is 1.

  ``Lib_1`` is similar to ``Lib_2``, but it does define a subprogram.
  Its control fan-in coupling is 1 (because there is one unit
  depending on it).

  When computing coupling metrics, ``gnatmetric`` counts only
  dependencies between units that are arguments of the ``gnatmetric``
  invocation. Coupling metrics are program-wide (or project-wide) metrics, so
  you should invoke ``gnatmetric`` for
  the complete set of sources comprising your program. This can be done
  by invoking ``gnatmetric`` with the corresponding project file
  and with the :switch:`-U` option.

  By default, all the coupling metrics are reported. You can use the following
  switches to select specific syntax metrics.

  .. index:: --tagged-coupling (gnatmetric)
  .. index:: --hierarchy-coupling (gnatmetric)
  .. index:: --unit-coupling (gnatmetric)
  .. index:: --control-coupling (gnatmetric)

  .. _Other_gnatmetric_Switches:

  Other ``gnatmetric`` Switches
  -----------------------------

  Additional ``gnatmetric`` switches are as follows:


  .. index:: --version (gnatmetric)

  :switch:`--version`
    Display copyright and version, then exit disregarding all other options.


  .. index:: --help (gnatmetric)

  :switch:`--help`
    Display usage, then exit disregarding all other options.


  .. index:: -P (gnatmetric)

  :switch:`-P {file}`
    Indicates the name of the project file that describes the set of sources
    to be processed. The exact set of argument sources depends on other options
    specified, see below. An aggregate project is allowed as the file parameter
    only if it has exactly one non-aggregate project being aggregated.


  .. index:: -U (gnatmetric)

  :switch:`-U`
    If a project file is specified and no argument source is explicitly
    specified (either directly or by means of :switch:`-files` option), process
    all the units of the closure of the argument project. Otherwise this option
    has no effect.


  :switch:`-U {main_unit}`
    If a project file is specified and no argument source is explicitly
    specified (either directly or by means of :switch:`-files` option), process
    the closure of units rooted at ``main_unit``. Otherwise this option
    has no effect.


  .. index:: -X (gnatmetric)

  :switch:`-X{name}={value}`
    Indicates that external variable ``name`` in the argument project
    has the value ``value``. Has no effect if no project is specified.


  .. index:: --RTS (gnatmetric)

  :switch:`--RTS={rts-path}`
    Specifies the default location of the runtime library. Same meaning as the
    equivalent ``gnatmake`` flag (see :ref:`Switches_for_gnatmake`).


  .. index:: --subdirs=dir (gnatmetric)

  :switch:`--subdirs={dir}`
    Use the specified subdirectory of the project objects file (or of the
    project file directory if the project does not specify an object directory)
    for tool output files. Has no effect if no project is specified as
    tool argument r if :switch:`--no-objects-dir` is specified.


  .. index:: --files (gnatmetric)

  :switch:`--files={file}`
    Take as arguments the files listed in text file ``file``.
    Text file ``file`` may contain empty lines that are ignored.
    Each nonempty line should contain the name of an existing file.
    Several such switches may be specified simultaneously.


  .. index:: --ignore (gnatmetric)

  :switch:`--ignore={filename}`
    Do not process the sources listed in a specified file.


  .. index:: --verbose (gnatmetric)

  :switch:`--verbose`
    Verbose mode;
    ``gnatmetric`` generates version information and then
    a trace of sources being processed.


  .. index:: --quiet (gnatmetric)

  :switch:`--quiet`
    Quiet mode.

  If a project file is specified and no argument source is explicitly
  specified (either directly or by means of :switch:`-files` option), and no
  :switch:`-U` is specified, then the set of processed sources is
  all the immediate units of the argument project.


  Legacy Switches
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  Some switches have a short form, mostly for legacy reasons,
  as shown below.

  .. index:: -x (gnatmetric)

   .. _The_GNAT_Pretty_Printer_gnatpp:

   The GNAT Pretty Printer ``gnatpp``
   ==================================

   .. index:: ! gnatpp
   .. index:: pretty printer

   The ``gnatpp`` tool is a utility for source reformatting / pretty
   printing. It takes an Ada source file as input and generates a
   reformatted version as output. You can specify various style
   directives via switches; e.g., identifier case conventions, rules of
   indentation, and comment layout.

   ``gnatpp`` is a project-aware tool
   (see :ref:`Using_Project_Files_with_GNAT_Tools` for a description of
   the project-related switches). The project file package that can specify
   ``gnatpp`` switches is named ``Pretty_Printer``.

   ``gnatpp`` cannot process sources that contain preprocessing
   directives.

   The ``gnatpp`` command has the form

     ::

        $ gnatpp [ switches ] filename

   where

   * ``switches`` is an optional sequence of switches defining such properties as
     the formatting rules, the source search path, and the destination for the
     output source file

   * ``filename`` is the name of the source file to reformat; wildcards
     or several file names on the same gnatpp command are allowed. The
     file name may contain path information; it does not have to follow
     the GNAT file naming rules

     Note that it is no longer necessary to specify the Ada language version;
     ``gnatpp`` can process Ada source code written in any version from
     Ada 83 onward without specifying any language version switch.


   .. _Switches_for_gnatpp:

   Switches for ``gnatpp``
   -----------------------

   The following subsections describe the various switches accepted by
   ``gnatpp``, organized by category.

   You specify a switch by supplying a name and generally also a value.
   In many cases the values for a switch with a given name are incompatible with
   each other
   (for example the switch that controls the casing of a reserved word may have
   exactly one value: upper case, lower case, or
   mixed case) and thus exactly one such switch can be in effect for an
   invocation of ``gnatpp``.
   If more than one is supplied, the last one is used.
   However, some values for the same switch are mutually compatible.
   You may supply several such switches to ``gnatpp``, but then
   each must be specified in full, with both the name and the value.
   Abbreviated forms (the name appearing once, followed by each value) are
   not permitted.

   .. _Alignment_Control:

   Alignment Control
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   .. index:: Alignment control in gnatpp

   Programs can be easier to read if certain constructs are vertically aligned.
   By default, alignment of the following constructs is set ON:

     * ``:`` in declarations,
     * ``:=`` in initializations in declarations,
     * ``:=`` in assignment statements,
     * ``=>`` in associations, and
     * ``at`` keywords in the component clauses in record representation clauses.

   In addition, ``in`` and ``out`` in parameter specifications are lined up.

   .. index:: --no-alignment (gnatpp)
   .. index:: --alignment (gnatpp)
   .. index:: --no-align-modes (gnatpp)


   :switch:`--no-alignment`
     Set alignment to OFF


   :switch:`--alignment`
     Set alignment to ON


   :switch:`--no-align-modes`
     Do not line up ``in`` and ``out`` in parameter specifications.

   .. _Casing_Control:


   Casing Control
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   .. index:: Casing control in gnatpp

   ``gnatpp`` allows you to specify the casing for reserved words,
   pragma names, attribute designators and identifiers.
   For identifiers you may define a
   general rule for name casing but also override this rule
   via a set of dictionary files.

   Three types of casing are supported: lower case, upper case, and mixed case.
   'Mixed case' means that the first letter, and also each letter immediately
   following an underscore, are converted to their uppercase forms;
   all the other letters are converted to their lowercase forms.

   (Note: the casing switches are not yet fully supported in the
   libadalang-based version of gnatpp.)

   .. index:: --name-case-as-declared (gnatpp)

   .. index:: --keyword-lower-case (gnatpp)

   :switch:`--keyword-lower-case`
     Keywords (technically, these are known in Ada as *reserved words*) are
     lower case (this is the default)

   .. index:: --keyword-upper-case (gnatpp)

   :switch:`--keyword-upper-case`
     Keywords are upper case

   .. index:: --enum-case-as-declared (gnatpp)

   :switch:`--enum-case-as-declared`
     Enumeration literal casing for defining occurrences are as they appear in the
     source file. Overrides -n casing setting.

   .. index:: --enum-upper-case (gnatpp)

     Enumeration literals are in upper case. Overrides -n casing
     setting.

   .. index:: --enum-lower-case (gnatpp)

   :switch:`--enum-lower-case`
     Enumeration literals are in lower case. Overrides -n casing
     setting.

   .. index:: --enum-mixed-case (gnatpp)

   :switch:`--enum-mixed-case`
     Enumeration literals are in mixed case. Overrides -n casing
     setting.

   .. index:: --type-case-as-declared (gnatpp)

   :switch:`--type-case-as-declared`
     Names introduced by type and subtype declarations are always
     cased as they appear in the declaration in the source file.
     Overrides -n casing setting.

   .. index:: --type-upper-case (gnatpp)

   :switch:`--type-upper-case`
     Names introduced by type and subtype declarations are always in
     upper case. Overrides -n casing setting.

   .. index:: --type-lower-case (gnatpp)

   :switch:`--type-lower-case`
     Names introduced by type and subtype declarations are always in
     lower case. Overrides -n casing setting.

   .. index:: --type-mixed-case (gnatpp)

   :switch:`--type-mixed-case`
     Names introduced by type and subtype declarations are always in
     mixed case. Overrides -n casing setting.

   .. index:: --number-upper-case (gnatpp)

   :switch:`--pragma-upper-case`
     Pragma names are upper case

   .. index:: --pragma-mixed-case (gnatpp)

   :switch:`--pragma-mixed-case`
     Pragma names are mixed case (this is the default)


   .. index:: --syntax-only (gnatpp)

   :switch:`--syntax-only`
     Disable the semantic analysis (name resolution) done by libadalang.
     This means gnatpp will not be able to support any of the
     "as-declared" switches.


   .. index:: --dictionary (gnatpp)

   :switch:`--dictionary={file}`
     Use ``file`` as a *dictionary file* that defines
     the casing for a set of specified names,
     thereby overriding the effect on these names by
     any explicit or implicit
     -n switch.
     To supply more than one dictionary file,
     use several ``--dictionary`` switches.

     ``gnatpp`` implicitly uses a *default dictionary file*
     to define the casing for the Ada predefined names and
     the names declared in the GNAT libraries.


   .. index:: --dictionary=- (gnatpp)

   :switch:`--dictionary=-`
     Do not use the default dictionary file;
     instead, use the casing
     defined by a ``-n`` switch and any explicit
     dictionary file(s)

   The structure of a dictionary file, and details on the conventions
   used in the default dictionary file, are defined in :ref:`Name_Casing`.

   The :switch:`--dictionary=-` and
   :switch:`--dictionary={file}` switches are mutually
   compatible.

   This group of ``gnatpp`` switches controls the layout of comments and
   complex syntactic constructs. See :ref:`Formatting_Comments` for details
   on their effect.


   .. index:: -c (gnatpp)


   :switch:`--comments-unchanged`
     All comments remain unchanged.


   :switch:`--comments-gnat-indentation`
     GNAT-style comment line indentation.
     This is the default.


   :switch:`--comments-gnat-beginning`
     GNAT-style comment beginning.


   :switch:`--comments-fill`
     Fill comment blocks.
     The default is :switch:`--no-comments-fill`.


   :switch:`--comments-special`
     Keep unchanged special form comments.
     The default is :switch:`--no-comments-special`.


   .. index:: --comments-only (gnatpp)

   :switch:`--comments-only`
     Format just the comments.

   .. index:: --no-end-id (gnatpp)


   :switch:`--no-end-id`
     Do not insert the name of a unit after ``end``; leave whatever comes
     after ``end``, if anything, alone.

   .. index:: --no-separate-is (gnatpp)


   :switch:`--no-separate-is`
     Do not place the keyword ``is`` on a separate line in a subprogram body in
     case if the spec occupies more than one line.

   .. index:: --no-separate-return (gnatpp)


   :switch:`--no-separate-return`
     In :switch:`--no-compact` mode, if a subprogram spec does not fit on
     one line, try to place the ``return`` on the same line as the last
     formal parameter.

   .. index:: --separate-loop (gnatpp)


   :switch:`--separate-loop`
     Place the keyword ``loop`` in FOR and WHILE loop statements
     on a separate line.

   .. index:: --no-separate-then (gnatpp)


   :switch:`--separate-then`
     Place the keyword ``then`` in IF statements
     on a separate line.

   .. index:: --no-separate-loop (gnatpp)


   :switch:`--no-separate-loop`
     Do not place the keyword ``loop`` in FOR and WHILE loop statements
     on a separate line. This option is
     incompatible with the :switch:`--separate-loop` option.

   .. index:: --no-separate-then (gnatpp)


   :switch:`--no-separate-then`
     Do not place the keyword ``then`` in IF statements
     on a separate line. This option is
     incompatible with the :switch:`--separate-then` option.

   .. index:: --separate-loop-then (gnatpp)


   :switch:`--separate-loop-then`
     Equivalent to :switch:`--separate-loop` :switch:`--separate-then`.

   .. index:: --no-separate-loop-then (gnatpp)


   :switch:`--no-separate-loop-then`
     Equivalent to :switch:`--no-separate-loop` :switch:`--no-separate-then`.

   .. index:: --use-on-new-line (gnatpp)


   :switch:`--use-on-new-line`
     Start each USE clause in a context clause from a separate line.


   .. index:: --insert-blank-lines (gnatpp)


   :switch:`--insert-blank-lines`
     Insert blank lines where appropriate (between bodies and other large
     constructs).

   .. index:: --preserve-blank-lines (gnatpp)


   :switch:`--preserve-blank-lines`
     Preserve blank lines in the input. By default, gnatpp will squeeze
     multiple blank lines down to one.

   .. index:: --preserve-line-breaks (gnatpp)

   :switch:`--preserve-line-breaks`
     Preserve line breaks in the input, to the extent possible.
     By default, line breaks are also inserted at appropriate
     places.

   .. index:: --source-line-breaks (gnatpp)

   :switch:`--source-line-breaks`
     Keep the line breaks from the source; do not insert or delete any
     line breaks.

   .. index:: --spaces-only (gnatpp)

   :switch:`--spaces-only`
     Disable all formatting except for inserting and removing spaces.
     This implies --source-line-breaks.

   The ``--comments`` switches are compatible with one another, except
   that the ``--comments-unchanged`` switch disables all other comment
   formatting switches.


   .. _General_Text_Layout_Control:

   General Text Layout Control
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   These switches allow control over line length and indentation.

   .. index:: --max-line-length (gnatpp)

   :switch:`--max-line-length={nnn}`
     Maximum line length, ``nnn`` from 32...256, the default value is 79


   .. index:: --indentation (gnatpp)

   :switch:`--indentation={nnn}`
     Indentation level, ``nnn`` from 1...9, the default value is 3


   .. index:: --indent-continuation (gnatpp)

   :switch:`--indent-continuation={nnn}`
     Indentation level for continuation lines (relative to the line being
     continued), ``nnn`` from 1...9.
     The default
     value is one less than the (normal) indentation level, unless the
     indentation is set to 1 (in which case the default value for continuation
     line indentation is also 1)


   .. _Other_Formatting_Options:

   Other Formatting Options
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   These switches control other formatting not listed above.

   .. index:: --decimal-grouping  (gnatpp)

   :switch:`--decimal-grouping={n}`
     Put underscores in decimal literals (numeric literals without a base)
     every ``n`` characters. If a literal already has one or more
     underscores, it is not modified. For example, with
     ``--decimal-grouping=3``, ``1000000`` will be changed to
     ``1_000_000``.


   .. index:: --based-grouping  (gnatpp)

   :switch:`--based-grouping={n}`
     Same as ``--decimal-grouping``, but for based literals. For
     example, with ``--based-grouping=4``, ``16#0001FFFE#`` will be
     changed to ``16#0001_FFFE#``.


   .. index:: --split-line-before-record (gnatpp)

   :switch:`--split-line-before-record`
     Split the line just before ``record`` in a record type declaration.


   .. index:: --indent-named-statements (gnatpp)

   :switch:`--indent-named-statements`
     Named block and loop statements are indented with respect to
     the name.


   .. index:: --split-line-before-op (gnatpp)

   :switch:`--split-line-before-op`
     If it is necessary to split a line at a binary operator, by default
     the line is split after the operator. With this option, it is split
     before the operator.


   .. index:: --RM-style-spacing (gnatpp)

   :switch:`--RM-style-spacing`
     Do not insert an extra blank before various occurrences of
     '(' and ':'. Alignment is off by default in this mode;
     use :switch:`--alignment` to turn it on.


   .. index:: --compact (gnatpp)
   .. index:: --no-compact (gnatpp)

   :switch:`--compact`
     This is the default. In calls and similar, this packs as many
     subexpressions on the same line as possible. Example:

     .. code-block:: ada

        Some_Procedure
          (Short_One, Another_Short_One,
           A_Very_Very_Very_Very_Very_Very_Very_Very_Long_One);

   :switch:`--no-compact`
     Turns off --compact mode. In calls and similar, if it is necessary
     to split a line between two subexpressions (because otherwise the
     construct would exceed --max-line-length), then all such subexpressions
     are placed on separate lines. Example:

     .. code-block:: ada

        Some_Procedure
          (Short_One,
           Another_Short_One,
           A_Very_Very_Very_Very_Very_Very_Very_Very_Long_One);


   .. index:: --call-threshold (gnatpp)

   :switch:`--call-threshold={nnn}`
     If the number of parameter associations is greater than ``nnn`` and if at
     least one association uses named notation, start each association from
     a new line. If ``nnn`` is 0, no check for the number of associations
     is made; this is the default.


   .. index:: --par-threshold (gnatpp)

   :switch:`--par-threshold={nnn}`
     If the number of parameter specifications is greater than ``nnn``
     (or equal to ``nnn`` in case of a function), start each specification from
     a new line. If ``nnn`` is 0, and :switch:`--no-separate-is` was not specified, then
     the ``is`` is placed on a separate line. This feature is disabled by default.

   .. index:: --vertical-enum-types (gnatpp)

   :switch:`--vertical-enum-types`
     Format enumeration type declarations "vertically", e.g. each
     enumeration literal goes on a separate line.

   .. index:: --vertical-array-types (gnatpp)

   :switch:`--vertical-array-types`
     Format array type declarations "vertically", e.g. for
     multidimensional arrays, each index_subtype_definition or
     discrete_subtype_definition goes on a separate line.

   .. index:: --vertical-named-aggregates (gnatpp)

   :switch:`--vertical-named-aggregates`
     Format aggregates "vertically" if named notation is used for all
     component_associations, e.g. each component_association
     goes on a separate line.

   .. index:: --vertical-case-alternatives (gnatpp)

   :switch:`--vertical-case-alternatives`
     Format case statements, case expressions, and variant parts with
     additional line breaks.


   .. _Setting_the_Source_Search_Path:

   Setting the Source Search Path
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   To define the search path for the input source file, ``gnatpp``
   uses the same switches as the GNAT compiler, with the same effects:

   .. index:: -I (gnatpp)


   :switch:`-I{dir}`

   .. index:: -I- (gnatpp)

   :switch:`-I-`

   .. index:: -gnatec (gnatpp)

   :switch:`-gnatec={path}`


   .. _Output_File_Control-gnatpp:

   Output File Control
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   By default the output overwrites the input file.
   The output may be redirected by the following switches:


   .. index:: --replace (gnatpp)

   :switch:`--replace`
     This is the default.
     Replace the input source file with the reformatted output without
     creating any backup copy of the input source.


   .. index:: --output-dir (gnatpp)

   :switch:`--output-dir={dir}`
     Generate output file in directory :file:`dir` with the same name as
     the input file. If :file:`dir` is the same as the directory
     containing the input file, the input file is not processed; use
     ``--replace`` if you want to update the input file in
     place.


   .. index:: --pipe (gnatpp)

   :switch:`--pipe`
     Send the output to ``Standard_Output``


   .. index:: --output (gnatpp)

   :switch:`--output={output_file}`
     Write the output into ``output_file``.
     If ``output_file`` already exists, ``gnatpp`` terminates without
     reading or processing the input file.


   .. index:: --output-force (gnatpp)

   :switch:`--output-force={output_file}`
     Write the output into ``output_file``, overwriting the existing file
     (if one is present).


   .. index:: --replace-backup (gnatpp)

   :switch:`--replace-backup`
     Replace the input source file with the reformatted output, and copy the
     original input source into the file whose name is obtained by appending the
     :file:`.npp` suffix to the name of the input file.
     If a file with this name already exists, ``gnatpp`` terminates without
     reading or processing the input file.


   .. index:: --replace-force-backup (gnatpp)

   :switch:`--replace-force-backup`
     Like ``--replace-backup`` except that if the file with the specified name
     already exists, it is overwritten.


   .. index:: --eol (gnatpp)

   :switch:`--eol={xxx}`
     Specifies the line-ending style of the reformatted output file. The
     ``xxx`` string specified with the switch may be:

     * *dos* - MS DOS style, lines end with CR LF characters*
     * *crlf*  - the same as *dos*
     * *unix* - UNIX style, lines end with LF character*
     * *lf* -  the same as *unix*

     The default is to use the same end-of-line convention as the input.

   .. index:: --wide-character-encoding (gnatpp)

   :switch:`--wide-character-encoding={e}`
     Specify the wide character encoding method for the input and output
     files. ``e`` is one of the following:

     * *8* - UTF-8 encoding

     * *b* - Brackets encoding (default value)

   Options ``--output-file`` and ``--output-force`` are allowed only if
   the call to gnatpp contains only one file to reformat.

   Option ``--eol`` and ``--wide-character-encoding`` cannot be used together
   with the ``--pipe`` option.


   .. _Other_gnatpp_Switches:

   Other ``gnatpp`` Switches
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   The additional ``gnatpp`` switches are defined in this subsection.


   .. index:: --version  (gnatpp)

   :switch:`--version`
     Display copyright and version, then exit disregarding all other options.


   .. index:: --help  (gnatpp)

   :switch:`--help`
     Display usage, then exit disregarding all other options.


   .. index:: -P  (gnatpp)

   :switch:`-P {file}`
     Indicates the name of the project file that describes the set of sources
     to be processed. The exact set of argument sources depends on other options
     specified; see below.


   .. index:: -U  (gnatpp)

   :switch:`-U`
     If a project file is specified and no argument source is explicitly
     specified (either directly or by means of ``--files`` option), process
     all the units of the closure of the argument project. Otherwise this option
     has no effect.


   :switch:`-U {main_unit}`
     If a project file is specified and no argument source is explicitly
     specified (either directly or by means of ``--files`` option), process
     the closure of units rooted at ``main_unit``. Otherwise this option
     has no effect.


   .. index:: -X  (gnatpp)

   :switch:`-X{name}={value}`
     Indicates that external variable ``name`` in the argument project
     has the value ``value``. Has no effect if no project is specified.


   .. index:: --RTS (gnatpp)

   :switch:`--RTS={rts-path}`
     Specifies the default location of the runtime library. Same meaning as the
     equivalent ``gnatmake`` flag (:ref:`Switches_for_gnatmake`).


   .. index:: --incremental  (gnatpp)

   :switch:`--incremental`
     Incremental processing on a per-file basis. Source files are only
     processed if they have been modified, or if files they depend on have
     been modified. This is similar to the way gnatmake/gprbuild only
     compiles files that need to be recompiled. A project file is required
     in this mode, and the gnat driver (as in *gnat pretty*) is not
     supported.
     (Note: this switch is not yet supported in the libadalang-based
     version of gnatpp.)


   .. index:: --pp-off  (gnatpp)

   :switch:`--pp-off={xxx}`
     Use :switch:`--xxx` as the command to turn off pretty printing, instead
     of the default ``--!pp off``.


   .. index:: --pp-on  (gnatpp)

   :switch:`--pp-on={xxx}`
     Use :switch:`--xxx` as the command to turn pretty printing back on, instead
     of the default ``--!pp on``.


   .. index:: --files (gnatpp)

   :switch:`--files={filename}`
     Take as arguments the files listed in text file ``file``.
     Text file ``file`` may contain empty lines that are ignored.
     Each nonempty line should contain the name of an existing file.
     Several such switches may be specified simultaneously.


   .. index:: --ignore (gnatpp)

   :switch:`--ignore={filename}`
     Do not process the sources listed in a specified file. This option cannot
     be used in incremental mode.

   .. index:: --jobs (gnatpp)

   :switch:`--jobs={n}`
     With ``--incremental``, use *n* ``gnatpp`` processes to perform
     pretty printing in parallel. If *n* is 0, then the maximum number
     processes is the number of core processors on the platform.


   .. index:: --verbose (gnatpp)

   :switch:`--verbose`
     Verbose mode


   .. index:: --quiet (gnatpp)

   :switch:`--quiet`
     Quiet mode

   If a project file is specified and no argument source is explicitly
   specified (either directly or by means of ``--files`` option), and no
   ``-U`` is specified, then the set of processed sources is
   all the immediate units of the argument project.


   .. _Formatting_Rules:

   Formatting Rules
   ----------------

   The following subsections show how ``gnatpp`` treats white space,
   comments, program layout, and name casing.
   They provide detailed descriptions of the switches shown above.


   .. _Disabling_Pretty_Printing:

   Disabling Pretty Printing
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   Pretty printing is highly heuristic in nature, and sometimes doesn't
   do exactly what you want. If you wish to format a certain region of
   code by hand, you can turn off pretty printing in that region by
   surrounding it with special comments that start with ``--!pp off``
   and ``--!pp on``. The text in that region will then be reproduced
   verbatim in the output with no formatting.

   To disable pretty printing for the whole file, put ``--!pp off`` at
   the top, with no following ``--!pp on``.

   The comments must appear on a line by themselves, with nothing
   preceding except spaces. The initial text of the comment must be
   exactly ``--!pp off`` or ``--!pp on`` (case sensitive), but may
   be followed by arbitrary additional text. For example:

     .. code-block:: ada

        package Interrupts is
           --!pp off -- turn off pretty printing so "Interrupt_Kind" lines up
           type            Interrupt_Kind is
             (Asynchronous_Interrupt_Kind,
               Synchronous_Interrupt_Kind,
                     Green_Interrupt_Kind);
           --!pp on -- reenable pretty printing
           ...

   You can specify different comment strings using the ``--pp-off``
   and ``--pp-on`` switches. For example, if you say:

     ::

        $ gnatpp --pp-off=' pp-' *.ad?

   then gnatpp will recognize comments of the form
   ``-- pp-`` instead of ``--!pp off`` for disabling pretty
   printing. Note that the leading ``--`` of the comment is not
   included in the argument to these switches.


   .. _White_Space_and_Empty_Lines:

   White Space and Empty Lines
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   ``gnatpp`` does not have an option to control space characters.
   It will add or remove spaces according to the style illustrated by the
   examples in the :title:`Ada Reference Manual`.
   The output file will contain no lines with trailing white space.

   By default, a sequence of one or more blank lines in the input is
   converted to a single blank line in the output; multiple blank lines
   are squeezed down to one.
   The ``--preserve-blank-lines`` option
   turns off the squeezing; each blank line in the input is copied
   to the output.
   The ``--insert-blank-lines`` option
   causes additional blank lines to be inserted if not already
   present in the input (e.g. between bodies).


   .. _Formatting_Comments:

   Formatting Comments
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   Comments in Ada code are of two kinds:

   * a *whole-line comment*, which appears by itself (possibly preceded by
     white space) on a line

   * an *end-of-line comment*, which follows some other Ada code on
     the same line.

   A whole-line comment is indented according to the surrounding code,
   with some exceptions. Comments that start in column 1 are kept
   there. If possible, comments are not moved so far to the right that
   the maximum line length is exceeded. The ``--comments-unchanged``
   option turns off comment formatting. Special-form comments such as
   SPARK-style ``--#...`` are left alone.

   For an end-of-line comment, ``gnatpp`` tries to leave the same
   number of spaces between the end of the preceding Ada code and the
   beginning of the comment as appear in the original source.

   The ``--comments-gnat-beginning`` switch (GNAT style comment
   beginning) has the following effect:

     * For each whole-line comment that does not end with two hyphens,
       ``gnatpp`` inserts spaces if necessary after the starting two
       hyphens to ensure that there are at least two spaces between
       these hyphens and the first non-blank character of the comment.

   The ``--comments-fill`` switch specifies that whole-line comments
   that form a paragraph will be filled in typical word processor style
   (that is, moving words between lines to make the lines other than the
   last similar in length ).

   The ``--comments-only`` switch specifies that only the comments are
   formatted; the rest of the program text is left alone. The comments
   are formatted according to the ``--comments-gnat-beginning`` and
   ``--comments-fill`` switches; other formatting switches are ignored. For
   example, ``--comments-only --comments-fill`` means to fill comment
   paragraphs, and do nothing else. Likewise, ``--comments-only
   --comments-gnat-beginning`` ensures comments start with at least two
   spaces after ``--``, and ``--comments-only --comments-gnat-beginning
   --comments-fill`` does both. If ``--comments-only`` is given without
   ``--comments-gnat-beginning`` or ``--comments-fill``, then gnatpp
   doesn't format anything.


   .. _Name_Casing:

   Name Casing
   ^^^^^^^^^^^

   ``gnatpp`` always converts the usage occurrence of a (simple) name to
   the same casing as the corresponding defining identifier.

   You control the casing for defining occurrences via the ``--name...``
   switches. With ``--name-case-as-declared``, which is the default,
   defining occurrences appear exactly as in the source file where they
   are declared. The other values for this switch --
   ``--name-upper-case``, ``--name-lower-case``, ``--name-mixed-case``
   -- result in upper, lower, or mixed case, respectively. If
   ``gnatpp`` changes the casing of a defining occurrence, it
   analogously changes the casing of all the usage occurrences of this
   name.

   If the defining occurrence of a name is not in the source compilation
   unit currently being processed by ``gnatpp``, the casing of each
   reference to this name is changed according to the switch (subject to
   the dictionary file mechanism described below). Thus ``gnatpp`` acts
   as though the switch had affected the casing for the defining
   occurrence of the name.

   The options
   :switch:`--attribute...`,
   :switch:`--keyword...`,
   :switch:`--enum...`,
   :switch:`--type...`,
   :switch:`--number...`, and
   :switch:`--pragma...`
   allow finer-grained control over casing for
   attributes, keywords, enumeration literals,
   types, named numbers and pragmas, respectively.
   :switch:`--type...` cover subtypes as well.

   Some names may need to be spelled with casing conventions that are not
   covered by the upper-, lower-, and mixed-case transformations.
   You can arrange correct casing by placing such names in a
   *dictionary file*,
   and then supplying a ``--dictionary`` switch.
   The casing of names from dictionary files overrides
   any ``--name...`` switch.

   To handle the casing of Ada predefined names and the names from GNAT libraries,
   ``gnatpp`` assumes a default dictionary file.
   The name of each predefined entity is spelled with the same casing as is used
   for the entity in the :title:`Ada Reference Manual` (usually mixed case).
   The name of each entity in the GNAT libraries is spelled with the same casing
   as is used in the declaration of that entity.

   The ``--dictionary=-`` switch suppresses the use of
   the default dictionary file. Instead, the casing for predefined and
   GNAT-defined names will be established by the
   ``-n`` switch or explicit dictionary files. For
   example, by default the names ``Ada.Text_IO`` and
   ``GNAT.OS_Lib`` will appear as just shown, even in the presence of
   a ``--name-upper-case`` switch. To ensure that even
   such names are rendered in uppercase, additionally supply the
   --dictionary=- switch (or else place these names
   in upper case in a dictionary file).

   A dictionary file is a plain text file; each line in this file can be
   either a blank line (containing only space characters), an Ada comment
   line, or the specification of exactly one *casing schema*.

   A casing schema is a string that has the following syntax:

     ::

        casing_schema ::= identifier | simple_identifier

        simple_identifier ::= letter{letter_or_digit}


   (See :title:`Ada Reference Manual`, Section 2.3) for the definition of the
   ``identifier`` lexical element and the ``letter_or_digit`` category.)

   The casing schema string can be followed by white space and/or an Ada-style
   comment; any amount of white space is allowed before the string.

   If a dictionary file is passed as
   the value of a :switch:`--dictionary={file}` switch
   then for every
   simple name and every identifier, ``gnatpp`` checks if the dictionary
   defines the casing for the name or for some of its parts (the term 'subword'
   is used below to denote the part of a name which is delimited by '_' or by
   the beginning or end of the word and which does not contain any '_' inside):

   * if the whole name is in the dictionary, ``gnatpp`` uses for this name
     the casing defined by the dictionary; no subwords are checked for this word

   * for every subword ``gnatpp`` checks if the dictionary contains the
     corresponding string of the form ``simple_identifier``,
     and if it does, the casing of this ``simple_identifier`` is used
     for this subword

   * if the whole name does not contain any '_' inside, and if for this name
     the dictionary contains two entries -- one of the form ``identifier``,
     and another of the form ``simple_identifier`` -- then the first one
     is applied to define the casing of this name

   * if more than one dictionary file is passed as ``gnatpp`` switches, each
     dictionary adds new casing exceptions and overrides all the existing casing
     exceptions set by the previous dictionaries

   * when ``gnatpp`` checks if the word or subword is in the dictionary,
     this check is not case sensitive

   For example, suppose we have the following source to reformat:

     .. code-block:: ada

        procedure test is
           name1 : integer := 1;
           name4_name3_name2 : integer := 2;
           name2_name3_name4 : Boolean;
           name1_var : Float;
        begin
           name2_name3_name4 := name4_name3_name2 > name1;
        end;

   And suppose we have two dictionaries:

     ::

        *dict1:*
           NAME1
           *NaMe3*
           *Name1*

        *dict2:*
          *NAME3*

   If ``gnatpp`` is called with the following switches:

     ::

        $ gnatpp --name-mixed-case --dictionary=dict1 --dictionary=dict2 test.adb

   then we will get the following name casing in the ``gnatpp`` output:


     .. code-block:: ada

        procedure Test is
           NAME1             : Integer := 1;
           Name4_NAME3_Name2 : Integer := 2;
           Name2_NAME3_Name4 : Boolean;
           Name1_Var         : Float;
        begin
           Name2_NAME3_Name4 := Name4_NAME3_Name2 > NAME1;
        end Test;

   .. _Preprocessor_directives:

   Preprocessor Directives
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   ``gnatpp`` has some support for preprocessor directives.
   You can use preprocessor symbols, as in ``$symbol``.
   In addition, you can use conditional compilation,
   so long as the program text is syntactically legal Ada code
   after removing all the preprocessor directives (lines starting
   with ``#``). For example, ``gnatpp`` can format the following:

     .. code-block:: ada

        package P is
        #IF SOMETHING
           X : constant Integer := 123;
        #ELSE
           X : constant Integer := 456;
        #END IF;
        end P;

   which will be formatted as if it were:

     .. code-block:: ada

        package P is
           X : constant Integer := 123;
           X : constant Integer := 456;
        end P;

   except that the ``#`` lines will be preserved.
   However, ``gnatpp`` cannot format the following:

     .. code-block:: ada

        procedure P is
        begin
        #IF SOMETHING
           if X = 0 then
        #ELSE
           if X = 1 then
        #END IF;
              null;
           end if;
        end P;

   because removing the ``#`` lines gives:

     .. code-block:: ada

        procedure P is
        begin
           if X = 0 then
           if X = 1 then
              null;
           end if;
        end P;

   which is not syntactically legal.

  .. _The_Body_Stub_Generator_gnatstub:

  The Body Stub Generator *gnatstub*
  ==================================

  .. index:: ! gnatstub

  ``gnatstub`` creates empty but compilable bodies
  for library unit declarations, and empty but compilable
  subunits for body stubs.

  ``gnatstub`` is a project-aware tool.
  (See :ref:`Using_Project_Files_with_GNAT_Tools` for a description of
  the project-related switches but note that ``gnatstub`` does not support
  the :switch:`-U`, :switch:`-U {main_unit}`, :switch:`--subdirs={dir}`, or
  :switch:`--no-objects-dir` switches.)
  The project file package that can specify
  ``gnatstub`` switches is named ``gnatstub``.


  By default, all the program unit bodies generated by ``gnatstub``
  raise ``Program_Error``, which will catch accidental calls of
  generated stubs. This behavior can be changed with option
  ``--no-exception`` (see below).

  .. _Running_gnatstub:

  Running ``gnatstub``
  --------------------

  ``gnatstub`` invocation has the following form:

    ::

       $ gnatstub [ switches ] {filename}

  where

  * *filename*
      is the name of the source file that contains a library unit declaration
      for which a body must be created or a library unit body for which subunits
      must be created for the body stubs declared in this body.
      The file name may contain path information.
      If the name does not follow GNAT file naming conventions and the set
      of switches does not contain a project file that defines naming
      conventions, the name of the body file must
      be provided
      explicitly as the value of the :switch:`--output={body-name}` option.
      If the file name follows the GNAT file naming
      conventions and the name of the body file is not provided,
      ``gnatstub``
      takes the naming conventions for the generated source from the
      project file provided as a parameter of ``-P`` switch if any,
      or creates the name file to generate using the standard GNAT
      naming conventions.

      Note that it is no longer necessary to specify the Ada language version;
      ``gnatmetric`` can process Ada source code written in any version from
      Ada 83 onward without specifying any language version switch.

  * *switches*
      is an optional sequence of switches as described in the next section


  .. _Switches_for_gnatstub:

  Switches for ``gnatstub``
  -------------------------

  .. index:: --version (gnatstub)

  :switch:`--version`
    Display copyright and version, then exit disregarding all other options.


  .. index:: --help (gnatstub)

  :switch:`--help`
    Display usage, then exit disregarding all other options.


  .. index:: -P (gnatstub)

  :switch:`-P {file}`
    Indicates the name of the project file that describes the set of sources
    to be processed. An aggregate project is allowed as the file parameter only
    if it has exactly one non-aggregate project being aggregated.


  .. index:: -X (gnatstub)

  :switch:`-X{name}={value}`
    Indicates that external variable ``name`` in the argument project
    has the value ``value``. Has no effect if no project is specified.


  .. index:: --RTS (gnatstub)

  :switch:`--RTS={rts-path}`
    Specifies the default location of the runtime library. Same meaning as the
    equivalent ``gnatmake`` flag (:ref:`Switches_for_gnatmake`).


  .. index:: --subunits (gnatstub)

  :switch:`--subunits`
    Generate subunits for body stubs. If this switch is specified,
    ``gnatstub`` expects a library unit body as an argument file;
    otherwise a library unit declaration is expected. If a body stub
    already has a corresponding subunit, ``gnatstub`` does not
    generate anything for it.


  .. index:: --force (gnatstub)

  :switch:`--force`
    If the destination directory already contains a file with the name of the
    body file
    for the argument spec file, replace it with the generated body stub.
    This switch cannot be used together with ``--subunits``.


  .. index:: --comment-header-spec (gnatstub)

  :switch:`--comment-header-spec`
    Put the comment header (i.e., all the comments preceding the
    compilation unit) from the source of the library unit declaration
    into the body stub.


  .. index:: --comment-header-sample (gnatstub)

  :switch:`--comment-header-sample`
    Put a sample comment header into the body stub.


  .. index:: --header-file (gnatstub)

  :switch:`--header-file={filename}`
    Use the content of the file as the comment header for a generated body stub.


  .. index:: --max-line-length (gnatstub)

  :switch:`--max-line-length={n}`
    (``n`` is a non-negative integer). Set the maximum line length for
    the output files. The default is 79. The maximum value that can be
    specified is 32767.


  .. index:: --indentation (gnatstub)

  :switch:`--indentation={n}`
    (``n`` is an integer from 1 to 9). Set the indentation level in
    the generated files to ``n``.
    The default indentation is 3.


  .. index:: --alphabetical-order (gnatstub)

  :switch:`--alphabetical-order`
    Order local bodies alphabetically. (By default local bodies are ordered
    in the same way as the corresponding local specs in the argument
    spec file.)


  .. index:: --no-exception (gnatstub)

  :switch:`--no-exception`
    Avoid raising Program_Error in the generated bodies of program unit stubs,
    except in the case of functions, where we have no value to return.


  .. index:: --no-local-header (gnatstub)

  :switch:`--no-local-header`
    Do not place local comment header with unit name before body stub for a
    unit.


  .. index:: --files (gnatstub)

  :switch:`--files={filename}`
    Take as arguments the files listed in text file ``file``.
    Text file ``file`` may contain empty lines that are ignored.
    Each nonempty line should contain the name of an existing file.
    Several such switches may be specified.


  .. index:: --output (gnatstub)

  :switch:`--output={body-name}`
    Body file name. This should be set if the argument file name does
    not follow the default GNAT file naming conventions, and the naming
    conventions are not specified by a project file. If this switch and
    ``-P`` are both omitted, the name for the body will be obtained
    according to the default GNAT file naming conventions.


  .. index:: --output-dir (gnatstub)

  :switch:`--output-dir={dir-name}`
    The directory in which to place the output files.
    If this switch is not set, the generated library unit body is
    placed in the current directory, and generated sununits
    in the directory where the argument body is located.


  .. index:: --wide-character-encoding (gnatstub)

  :switch:`--wide-character-encoding={e}`
    Specify the wide character encoding method for the input and output
    files. ``e`` is one of the following:

    * *8* - UTF-8 encoding

    * *b* - Brackets encoding (default value)


  .. index:: --quiet (gnatstub)
  .. index:: -q (gnatstub)

  :switch:`--quiet` / :switch:`-q`
    Quiet mode.


  .. index:: --verbose (gnatstub)
  .. index:: -v (gnatstub)

  :switch:`--verbose` / :switch:`-v`
    Verbose mode.

  .. _The_Unit_Test_Generator_gnattest:

  The Unit Test Generator ``gnattest``
  ====================================

  .. index:: ! gnattest

  ``gnattest`` is an ASIS-based utility that creates unit-test skeletons
  as well as a test driver infrastructure (harness). ``gnattest`` creates
  a skeleton for each visible subprogram in the packages under consideration when
  they do not exist already.

  ``gnattest`` is a project-aware tool.
  (See :ref:`Using_Project_Files_with_GNAT_Tools` for a description of
  the project-related switches but note that ``gnattest`` does not support
  the :switch:`-U`, :switch:`-eL`, :switch:`--subdirs={dir}`, or
  :switch:`--no-objects-dir` switches.)
  The project file package that can specify
  ``gnattest`` switches is named ``gnattest``.

  The user can choose to generate a single test driver
  that will run all individual tests, or separate test drivers for each test. The
  second option allows much greater flexibility in test execution environment,
  allows to benefit from parallel tests execution to increase performance, and
  provides stubbing support.

  ``gnattest`` also has a mode of operation where it acts as the test
  aggregator when multiple test executables must be run, in particular when
  the separate test drivers were generated. In this mode it handles individual
  tests execution and upon completion reports the summary results of the test
  run.

  In order to process source files from a project, ``gnattest`` has to
  semantically analyze the sources. Therefore, test skeletons can only be
  generated for legal Ada units. If a unit is dependent on other units,
  those units should be among the source files of the project or of other projects
  imported by this one.

  Generated skeletons and harnesses are based on the AUnit testing framework.
  AUnit is an Ada adaptation of the xxxUnit testing frameworks, similar to JUnit
  for Java or CppUnit for C++. While it is advised that gnattest users read
  the AUnit manual, deep knowledge of AUnit is not necessary for using ``gnattest``.
  For correct operation of ``gnattest``, AUnit should be installed and
  aunit.gpr must be on the project path. Except for some special circumstances
  (e.g. a custom run-time is used), this should normally be the case out of the box.

        $ gnattest -Pprojname [ switches ] [ filename ] [ -cargs gcc_switches ]

  where

  * :switch:`-P{projname}`
      specifies the project defining the location of source files. When no
      file names are provided on the command line, all sources in the project
      are used as input. This switch is required.

  * :switch:`{filename}`
      is the name of the source file containing the library unit package *declaration*
      (the package "spec") for which a test package will be created. The file name
      may be given with a path.

  * :samp:`{switches}`
      is an optional sequence of switches as described below.

  * :samp:`{gcc_switches}`
      is a list of additional switches for
      ``gcc`` that will be passed to all compiler invocations
      made by ``gnattest`` to generate a set of ASIS trees.


  ``gnattest`` results can be found in two different places.

  * *automatic harness*:
      This is the harness code, which is located by default in
      "gnattest/harness" directory created in the object directory of
      the main project file. All of this code is generated completely
      automatically and can be destroyed and regenerated at will, with the
      exception of the file *gnattest_common.gpr*, which is created if absent,
      but never overwritten. It is not recommended to modify other files
      manually, since these modifications will be lost if ``gnattest`` is re-run.
      The entry point in the harness code is
      the project file named *test_driver.gpr*. Tests can be compiled and run
      using a command such as:

      ::

         $ gprbuild -P<harness-dir>/test_driver

      Note that if you need to adjust any options used to compile the harness,
      you can do so by editing the file *gnattest_common.gpr*.

  * *actual unit test skeletons*:
      A test skeleton for each visible subprogram is created in a separate file, if it
      doesn't exist already. By default, those separate test files are located in a
      "gnattest/tests" directory that is created in the object directory of
      corresponding project file. For example, if a source file my_unit.ads in
      directory src contains a visible subprogram Proc, then the corresponding unit
      test will be found in file src/tests/my_unit-test_data-tests.adb and will be
      called Test_Proc_<code>. <code> is a signature encoding used to differentiate
      test names in case of overloading.

      Note that if the project already has both my_unit.ads and my_unit-test_data.ads,
      this will cause a name conflict with the generated test package.


  .. _Test_Execution_Mode:

  Test Execution Mode
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  In this  mode ``gnattest`` has a the following command-line interface:

    ::

        $ gnattest test_drivers.list [ switches ]

  where

  * :samp:`{test_drivers.list}`
       is the name of the text file containing the list of executables to treat as
       test drivers. This file is automatically generated by gnattest, but can be
       hand-edited to add or remove tests. This switch is required.


  * :samp:`{switches}`
       is an optional sequence of switches as described below.


  .. _Switches_for_gnattest_in_framework_generation_mode:

  Switches for ``gnattest`` in framework generation mode
  ------------------------------------------------------

    .. index:: --strict (gnattest)

  :switch:`--strict`
    Return error exit code if there are any compilation errors.

    .. index:: -q (gnattest)

  :switch:`-q`
    Quiet mode: suppresses noncritical output messages.


    .. index:: -v (gnattest)

  :switch:`-v`
    Verbose mode: produces additional output about the execution of the tool.
    When specified alone on the command line, prints tool version and exits.


    .. index:: -r (gnattest)

  :switch:`-r`
    Recursively considers all sources from all projects.

    .. index:: -files (gnattest)

  :switch:`-files={filename}`
    Take as arguments the files listed in text file ``file``.
    Text file ``file`` may contain empty lines that are ignored.
    Each nonempty line should contain the name of an existing file.
    Several such switches may be specified simultaneously.

    .. index:: --ignore (gnattest)

  :switch:`--ignore={filename}`
    Do not process the sources listed in a specified file.

    .. index:: --RTS (gnattest)

  :switch:`--RTS={rts-path}`
    Specifies the default location of the runtime library. Same meaning as the
    equivalent ``gnatmake`` flag (:ref:`Switches_for_gnatmake`). For restricted
    profiles, ``gnattest`` takes into account the run-time limitations when
    generating the harness.


    .. index:: --additional-tests (gnattest)

  :switch:`--additional-tests={projname}`
    Sources described in ``projname`` are considered potential additional
    manual tests to be added to the test suite.


    .. index:: --harness-only (gnattest)

  :switch:`--harness-only`
    When this option is given, ``gnattest`` creates a harness for all
    sources, treating them as test packages. This option is not compatible with
    closure computation done by -U main.


    .. index:: --separate-drivers (gnattest)

  :switch:`--separate-drivers[={val}]`
    Generates a separate test driver for each test or unit under test, rather
    than a single executable incorporating all tests. ``val`` can be "unit" or
    "test", or may be omitted, which defaults to "unit".


    .. index:: --stub (gnattest)

  :switch:`--stub`
    Generates the testing framework that uses subsystem stubbing to isolate the
    code under test.


    .. index:: --harness-dir (gnattest)

  :switch:`--harness-dir={dirname}`
    Specifies the directory that will hold the harness packages and project file
    for the test driver. If the ``dirname`` is a relative path, it is considered
    relative to the object directory of the project file.


    .. index:: --tests-dir (gnattest)

  :switch:`--tests-dir={dirname}`
    All test packages are placed in the ``dirname`` directory.
    If the ``dirname`` is a relative path, it is considered relative to the object
    directory of the project file. When all sources from all projects are taken
    recursively from all projects, ``dirname`` directories are created for each
    project in their object directories and test packages are placed accordingly.


    .. index:: --subdir (gnattest)

  :switch:`--subdir={dirname}`
    Test packages are placed in a subdirectory of the corresponding source
    directory, with the name ``dirname``. Thus, each set of unit tests is located
    in a subdirectory of the code under test. If the sources are in separate
    directories, each source directory has a test subdirectory named ``dirname``.


    .. index:: --tests-root (gnattest)

  :switch:`--tests-root={dirname}`
    The hierarchy of source directories, if any, is recreated in the ``dirname``
    directory, with test packages placed in directories corresponding to those
    of the sources.
    If the ``dirname`` is a relative path, it is considered relative to the object
    directory of the project file. When projects are considered recursively,
    directory hierarchies of tested sources are
    recreated for each project in their object directories and test packages are
    placed accordingly.


    .. index:: --stubs-dir (gnattest)

  :switch:`--stubs-dir={dirname}`
    The hierarchy of directories containing stubbed units is recreated in
    the ``dirname`` directory, with stubs placed in directories corresponding to
    projects they are derived from.
    If the ``dirname`` is a relative path, it is considered relative to the object
    directory of the project file. When projects are considered recursively,
    directory hierarchies of stubs are
    recreated for each project in their object directories and test packages are
    placed accordingly.


    .. index:: --exclude-from-stubbing (gnattest)

  :switch:`--exclude-from-stubbing={filename}`
    Disables stubbing of units listed in ``filename``. The file should contain
    corresponding spec files, one per line.

  :switch:`--exclude-from-stubbing:{unit}={filename}`
    Same as above, but corresponding units will not be stubbed only when testing
    specified ``unit``.

    .. index:: --validate-type-extensions (gnattest)

  :switch:`--validate-type-extensions`
    Enables substitution check: run all tests from all parents in order
    to check substitutability in accordance with the Liskov substitution principle (LSP).

    .. index:: --inheritance-check (gnattest)

  :switch:`--inheritance-check`
    Enables inheritance check: run inherited tests against descendants.

    .. index:: --no-inheritance-check (gnattest)

  :switch:`--no-inheritance-check`
    Disables inheritance check.

    .. index:: --no-inheritance-check (gnattest)

  :switch:`--test-case-only`
    Generates test skeletons only for subprograms that have at least one
    associated pragma or aspect Test_Case.

    .. index:: --skeleton-default (gnattest)

  :switch:`--skeleton-default={val}`
    Specifies the default behavior of generated skeletons. ``val`` can be either
    "fail" or "pass", "fail" being the default.


    .. index:: --passed-tests (gnattest)

  :switch:`--passed-tests={val}`
    Specifies whether or not passed tests should be shown. ``val`` can be either
    "show" or "hide", "show" being the default.


    .. index:: --exit-status (gnattest)

  :switch:`--exit-status={val}`
    Specifies whether or not generated test driver should return failure exit
    status if at least one test fails or crashes. ``val`` can be either
    "on" or "off", "off" being the default.


    .. index:: --omit-sloc (gnattest)

  :switch:`--omit-sloc`
    Suppresses comment line containing file name and line number of corresponding
    subprograms in test skeletons.


    .. index:: --no-command-line (gnattest)

  :switch:`--no-command-line`
    Don't add command line support to test driver. Note that regardless of this
    switch, ``gnattest`` will automatically refrain from adding command
    line support if it detects that the selected run-time doesn't provide
    this capability.


    .. index:: --separates (gnattest)

  :switch:`--separates`
    Bodies of all test routines are generated as separates. Note that this mode is
    kept for compatibility reasons only and it is not advised to use it due to
    possible problems with hash in names of test skeletons when using an
    inconsistent casing. Separate test skeletons can be incorporated to monolith
    test package with improved hash being used by using ``--transition``
    switch.


    .. index:: --transition (gnattest)

  :switch:`--transition`
    This allows transition from separate test routines to monolith test packages.
    All matching test routines are overwritten with contents of corresponding
    separates. Note that if separate test routines had any manually added with
    clauses they will be moved to the test package body as is and have to be moved
    by hand.


    .. index:: --test-duration (gnattest)

  :switch:`--test-duration`
    Adds time measurements for each test in generated test driver.


  :switch:`--tests_root`, :switch:`--subdir` and :switch:`--tests-dir` switches are mutually exclusive.


  .. _Switches_for_gnattest_in_test_execution_mode:

  Switches for ``gnattest`` in test execution mode
  ------------------------------------------------


    .. index:: --passed-tests (gnattest)

  :switch:`--passed-tests={val}`
    Specifies whether or not passed tests should be shown. ``val`` can be either
    "show" or "hide", "show" being the default.


    .. index:: --queues (gnattest)
    .. index:: -j (gnattest)

  :switch:`--queues={n}`, :switch:`-j{n}`
    Runs ``n`` tests in parallel (default is 1).


    .. index:: --copy-environment (gnattest)

  :switch:`--copy-environment={dir}`
    Contents of ``dir`` directory will be copied to temporary directories
    created by gnattest in which individual test drivers are spawned.


  .. _Project_Attributes_for_gnattest:

  Project Attributes for ``gnattest``
  -----------------------------------

  Most of the command-line options can also be passed to the tool by adding
  special attributes to the project file. Those attributes should be put in
  package ``Gnattest``. Here is the list of attributes:


  * ``Tests_Root``
       is used to select the same output mode as with the ``--tests-root`` option.
       This attribute cannot be used together with ``Subdir`` or ``Tests_Dir``.

  * ``Subdir``
       is used to select the same output mode as with the ``--subdir`` option.
       This attribute cannot be used together with ``Tests_Root`` or ``Tests_Dir``.

  * ``Tests_Dir``
       is used to select the same output mode as with the ``--tests-dir`` option.
       This attribute cannot be used together with ``Subdir`` or ``Tests_Root``.

  * ``Stubs_Dir``
       is used to select the same output mode as with the ``--stubs-dir`` option.

  * ``Harness_Dir``
       is used to specify the directory in which to place harness packages and project
       file for the test driver, otherwise specified by ``--harness-dir``.

  * ``Additional_Tests``
       is used to specify the project file, otherwise given by
       ``--additional-tests`` switch.

  * ``Skeletons_Default``
       is used to specify the default behaviour of test skeletons, otherwise
       specified by ``--skeleton-default`` option. The value of this attribute
       should be either ``pass`` or ``fail``.

  * ``Default_Stub_Exclusion_List``
       is used to specify the file with list of units whose bodies should not
       be stubbed, otherwise specified by ``--exclude-from-stubbing=filename``.

  * ``Stub_Exclusion_List ("unit")``
       is used to specify the file with list of units whose bodies should not
       be stubbed when testing "unit", otherwise specified by
       ``--exclude-from-stubbing:unit=filename``.

  Each of those attributes can be overridden from the command line if needed.
  Other ``gnattest`` switches can also be passed via the project
  file as an attribute list called ``Gnattest_Switches``.


  .. _Simple_gnattest_Example:

  Simple Example
  --------------

  Let's take a very simple example using the first ``gnattest`` example
  located in:

    ::

        <install_prefix>/share/examples/gnattest/simple

  This project contains a simple package containing one subprogram. By running ``gnattest``:

    ::

        $ gnattest --harness-dir=driver -Psimple.gpr

  a test driver is created in directory ``driver``. It can be compiled and run:

    ::

       $ cd obj/driver
       $ gprbuild -Ptest_driver
       $ test_runner

  One failed test with the diagnosis "test not implemented" is reported.
  Since no special output option was specified, the test package ``Simple.Tests``
  is located in:

    ::

        <install_prefix>/share/examples/gnattest/simple/obj/gnattest/tests


  For each package containing visible subprograms, a child test package is
  generated. It contains one test routine per tested subprogram. Each
  declaration of a test subprogram has a comment specifying which tested
  subprogram it corresponds to. Bodies of test routines are placed in test package
  bodies and are surrounded by special comment sections. Those comment sections
  should not be removed or modified in order for gnattest to be able to regenerate
  test packages and keep already written tests in place.
  The test routine ``Test_Inc_5eaee3`` located at :file:`simple-test_data-tests.adb` contains
  a single statement: a call to procedure ``Assert``. It has two arguments:
  the Boolean expression we want to check and the diagnosis message to display if
  the condition is false.

  That is where actual testing code should be written after a proper setup.
  An actual check can be performed by replacing the ``Assert`` call with:

    ::

        Assert (Inc (1) = 2, "wrong incrementation");

  After recompiling and running the test driver, one successfully passed test
  is reported.


  .. _Setting_Up_and_Tearing_Down_the_Testing_Environment:

  Setting Up and Tearing Down the Testing Environment
  ---------------------------------------------------

  Besides test routines themselves, each test package has a parent package
  ``Test_Data`` that has two procedures: ``Set_Up`` and ``Tear_Down``. This package is never
  overwritten by the tool. ``Set_Up`` is called before each test routine of the
  package, and ``Tear_Down`` is called after each test routine. Those two procedures
  can be used to perform necessary initialization and finalization,
  memory allocation, etc. Test type declared in ``Test_Data`` package is parent type
  for the test type of test package and can have user-defined components whose
  values can be set by ``Set_Up`` routine and used in test routines afterwards.


  .. _Regenerating_Tests:

  Regenerating Tests
  ------------------

  Bodies of test routines and ``Test_Data`` packages are never overridden after they
  have been created once. As long as the name of the subprogram, full expanded Ada
  names and order of its parameters are the same, and comment sections are
  intact, the old test routine will fit in its place and no test skeleton will be
  generated for the subprogram.

  This can be demonstrated with the previous example. By uncommenting declaration
  and body of function Dec in ``simple.ads`` and ``simple.adb``, running
  ``gnattest`` on the project, and then running the test driver:

    ::

        $ gnattest --harness-dir=driver -Psimple.gpr
        $ cd obj/driver
        $ gprbuild -Ptest_driver
        $ test_runner

  The old test is not replaced with a stub, nor is it lost, but a new test
  skeleton is created for function ``Dec``.

  The only way of regenerating tests skeletons is to remove the previously created
  tests together with corresponding comment sections.


  .. _Default_Test_Behavior:

  Default Test Behavior
  ---------------------

  The generated test driver can treat unimplemented tests in two ways:
  either count them all as failed (this is useful to see which tests are still
  left to implement) or as passed (to sort out unimplemented ones from those
  actually failing).

  The test driver accepts a switch to specify this behavior:
  :switch:`--skeleton-default={val}`, where ``val`` is either ``pass`` or ``fail`` (exactly as for
  ``gnattest``).

  The default behavior of the test driver is set with the same switch
  as passed to ``gnattest`` when generating the test driver.

  Passing it to the driver generated on the first example:

    ::

        $ test_runner --skeleton-default=pass

  makes both tests pass, even the unimplemented one.


  .. _Testing_Primitive_Operations_of_Tagged_Types:

  Testing Primitive Operations of Tagged Types
  --------------------------------------------

  Creation of test skeletons for primitive operations of tagged types entails
  a number of features. Test routines for all primitives of a given tagged type
  are placed in a separate child package named according to the tagged type. For
  example, if you have tagged type ``T`` in package ``P``, all tests for primitives
  of ``T`` will be in ``P.T_Test_Data.T_Tests``.

  Consider running ``gnattest`` on the second example (note: actual tests for this
  example already exist, so there's no need to worry if the tool reports that
  no new stubs were generated):

    ::

        $ cd <install_prefix>/share/examples/gnattest/tagged_rec
        $ gnattest --harness-dir=driver -Ptagged_rec.gpr

  Taking a closer look at the test type declared in the test package
  *Speed1.Controller_Test_Data* is necessary. It is declared in:

    ::

        <install_prefix>/share/examples/gnattest/tagged_rec/obj/gnattest/tests

  Test types are direct or indirect descendants of
  *AUnit.Test_Fixtures.Test_Fixture* type. In the case of non-primitive tested
  subprograms, the user doesn't need to be concerned with them. However,
  when generating test packages for primitive operations, there are some things
  the user needs to know.

  Type ``Test_Controller`` has components that allow assignment of various
  derivations of type ``Controller``. And if you look at the specification of
  package *Speed2.Auto_Controller*, you will see that ``Test_Auto_Controller``
  actually derives from ``Test_Controller`` rather than AUnit type ``Test_Fixture``.
  Thus, test types mirror the hierarchy of tested types.

  The ``Set_Up`` procedure of ``Test_Data`` package corresponding to a test package
  of primitive operations of type ``T`` assigns to ``Fixture`` a reference to an
  object of that exact type ``T``. Note, however, that if the tagged type has
  discriminants, the ``Set_Up`` only has a commented template for setting
  up the fixture, since filling the discriminant with actual value is up
  to the user.

  The knowledge of the structure of test types allows additional testing
  without additional effort. Those possibilities are described below.


  .. _Testing_Inheritance:

  Testing Inheritance
  -------------------

  Since the test type hierarchy mimics the hierarchy of tested types, the
  inheritance of tests takes place. An example of such inheritance can be
  seen by running the test driver generated for the second example. As previously
  mentioned, actual tests are already written for this example.

    ::

        $ cd obj/driver
        $ gprbuild -Ptest_driver
        $ test_runner

  There are 6 passed tests while there are only 5 testable subprograms. The test
  routine for function Speed has been inherited and run against objects of the
  derived type.


  .. _Tagged_Type_Substitutability_Testing:

  Tagged Type Substitutability Testing
  ------------------------------------

  *Tagged Type Substitutability Testing* is a way of verifying the global type
  consistency by testing. Global type consistency is a principle stating that if
  ``S`` is a subtype of ``T`` (in Ada, ``S`` is a derived type of tagged type ``T``),
  then objects of type ``T`` may be replaced with objects of type ``S`` (that is,
  objects of type ``S`` may be substituted for objects of type ``T``), without
  altering any of the desirable properties of the program. When the properties
  of the program are expressed in the form of subprogram preconditions and
  postconditions (let's call them pre and post), the principle is formulated as
  relations between the pre and post of primitive operations and the pre and post
  of their derived operations. The pre of a derived operation should not be
  stronger than the original pre, and the post of the derived operation should
  not be weaker than the original post. Those relations ensure that verifying if
  a dispatching call is safe can be done just by using the pre and post of the
  root operation.

  Verifying global type consistency by testing consists of running all the unit
  tests associated with the primitives of a given tagged type with objects of its
  derived types.

  In the example used in the previous section, there was clearly a violation of
  type consistency. The overriding primitive ``Adjust_Speed`` in package ``Speed2``
  removes the functionality of the overridden primitive and thus doesn't respect
  the consistency principle.
  ``gnattest`` has a special option to run overridden parent tests against objects
  of the type which have overriding primitives:

    ::

        $ gnattest --harness-dir=driver --validate-type-extensions -Ptagged_rec.gpr
        $ cd obj/driver
        $ gprbuild -Ptest_driver
        $ test_runner

  While all the tests pass by themselves, the parent test for ``Adjust_Speed`` fails
  against objects of the derived type.

  Non-overridden tests are already inherited for derived test types, so the
  ``--validate-type-extensions`` enables the application of overridden tests
  to objects of derived types.


  .. _Testing_with_Contracts:

  Testing with Contracts
  ----------------------

  ``gnattest`` supports pragmas ``Pre``, ``Post``, and ``Test_Case``,
  as well as the corresponding Ada 2012 aspects.
  Test routines are generated, one per each ``Test_Case`` associated with a tested
  subprogram. Those test routines have special wrappers for tested functions
  that have composition of pre- and postcondition of the subprogram with
  "requires" and "ensures" of the ``Test_Case`` (depending on the mode, pre and post
  either count for ``Nominal`` mode or do *not* count for ``Robustness`` mode).

  The third example demonstrates how this works:

    ::

        $ cd <install_prefix>/share/examples/gnattest/contracts
        $ gnattest --harness-dir=driver -Pcontracts.gpr

  Putting actual checks within the range of the contract does not cause any
  error reports. For example, for the test routine which corresponds to
  test case 1:

    ::

        Assert (Sqrt (9.0) = 3.0, "wrong sqrt");

  and for the test routine corresponding to test case 2:

    ::

        Assert (Sqrt (-5.0) = -1.0, "wrong error indication");

  are acceptable:

    ::

        $ cd obj/driver
        $ gprbuild -Ptest_driver
        $ test_runner

  However, by changing 9.0 to 25.0 and 3.0 to 5.0, for example, you can get
  a precondition violation for test case one. Also, by using any otherwise
  correct but positive pair of numbers in the second test routine, you can also
  get a precondition violation. Postconditions are checked and reported
  the same way.


  .. _Additional_Tests:

  Additional Tests
  ----------------

  ``gnattest`` can add user-written tests to the main suite of the test
  driver. ``gnattest`` traverses the given packages and searches for test
  routines. All procedures with a single in out parameter of a type which is
  derived from *AUnit.Test_Fixtures.Test_Fixture* and that are declared in package
  specifications are added to the suites and are then executed by the test driver.
  (``Set_Up`` and ``Tear_Down`` are filtered out.)

  An example illustrates two ways of creating test harnesses for user-written
  tests. Directory ``additional_tests`` contains an AUnit-based test driver written
  by hand.

    ::

        <install_prefix>/share/examples/gnattest/additional_tests/

  To create a test driver for already-written tests, use the ``--harness-only``
  option:

    ::

        gnattest -Padditional/harness/harness.gpr --harness-dir=harness_only \\
          --harness-only
        gprbuild -Pharness_only/test_driver.gpr
        harness_only/test_runner

  Additional tests can also be executed together with generated tests:

    ::

        gnattest -Psimple.gpr --additional-tests=additional/harness/harness.gpr \\
          --harness-dir=mixing
        gprbuild -Pmixing/test_driver.gpr
        mixing/test_runner


  .. _Individual_Test_Drivers:

  Individual Test Drivers
  -----------------------

  By default, ``gnattest`` generates a monolithic test driver that
  aggregates the individual tests into a single executable. It is also possible
  to generate separate executables for each test or each unit under test, by
  passing the switch ``--separate-drivers`` with corresponding parameter. This
  approach scales better for large testing campaigns, especially involving target
  architectures with limited resources typical for embedded development. It can
  also provide a major performance benefit on multi-core systems by allowing
  simultaneous execution of multiple tests.

  ``gnattest`` can take charge of executing the individual tests; for this,
  instead of passing a project file, a text file containing the list of
  executables can be passed. Such a file is automatically generated by gnattest
  under the name :file:`test_drivers.list`, but it can be
  hand-edited to add or remove tests, or replaced. The individual tests can
  also be executed standalone, or from any user-defined scripted framework.


  .. _Stubbing:

  Stubbing
  --------

  Depending on the testing campaign, it is sometimes necessary to isolate the
  part of the algorithm under test from its dependencies. This is accomplished
  via *stubbing*, i.e. replacing the subprograms that are called from the
  subprogram under test by stand-in subprograms that match the profiles of the
  original ones, but simply return predetermined values required by the test
  scenario.

  This mode of test harness generation is activated by the switch ``--stub``.

  The implementation approach chosen by ``gnattest`` is as follows.
  For each package under consideration all the packages it is directly depending
  on are stubbed, excluding the generic packages and package instantiations.
  The stubs are shared for each package under test. The specs of packages to stub
  remain intact, while their bodies are replaced, and hide the original bodies by
  means of extending projects. Also, for each stubbed
  package, a child package with setter routines for each subprogram declaration
  is created. These setters are meant to be used to set the behavior of
  stubbed subprograms from within test cases.

  Note that subprograms belonging to the same package as the subprogram under
  test are not stubbed. This guarantees that the sources being tested are
  exactly the sources used for production, which is an important property for
  establishing the traceability between the testing campaign and production code.

  Due to the nature of stubbing process, this mode implies the switch
  ``--separate-drivers``, i.e. an individual test driver (with the
  corresponding hierarchy of extending projects) is generated for each unit under
  test.

  .. note::

     Developing a stubs-based testing campaign requires
     good understanding of the infrastructure created by ``gnattest`` for
     this purpose. We recommend following the two stubbing tutorials
     ``simple_stubbing`` and ``advanced_stubbing`` provided
     under :file:`<install_prefix>/share/examples/gnattest` before
     attempting to use this powerful feature.


  .. _Gnatcov_Integration:

  Integration with GNATcoverage
  -----------------------------

  In addition to the harness, ``gnattest`` generates a Makefile. This Makefile
  provides targets for building the test drivers and also the targets for
  computing the coverage information using GNATcoverage framework when this
  coverage analysis tool is available. The target ``coverage`` fully automates
  the process: it will first build all test drivers, then run them under
  GNATcoverage, analyze individual trace files, and finally aggregate them:

    ::

        make coverage

  GNATcoverage options, such as coverage criteria and generated report format,
  can be adjusted using Makefile variables provided for this purpose.

  Note that coverage targets are not generated in the Makefile when
  --separate-drivers=test is passed to gnattest.


  .. _Putting_Tests_under_Version_Control:

  Putting Tests under Version Control
  -----------------------------------

  As has been stated earlier, ``gnattest`` generates two different types
  of code, test skeletons and harness. The harness is generated completely
  automatically each time, does not require manual changes and therefore should
  not be put under version control.
  It makes sense to put under version control files containing test data packages,
  both specs and bodies, and files containing bodies of test packages. Note that
  test package specs are also generated automatically each time and should not be
  put under version control.
  Option ``--omit-sloc`` may be useful when putting test packages under version control.


  .. _Current_Limitations:

  Current Limitations
  -------------------

  The tool currently has the following limitations:

  * generic tests for nested generic packages and their instantiations are
    not supported;
  * tests for protected subprograms and entries are not supported;
  * pragma ``No_Run_Time`` is not supported;
  * pragma ``No_Secondary_Stack`` is not supported;
  * if pragmas for interfacing with foreign languages are used, manual
    adjustments might be necessary to make the test harness compilable;
  * use of some constructs, such as elaboration-control pragmas, Type_Invariant
    aspects, and complex variable initializations that use Subprogram'Access,
    may result in elaboration circularities in the generated harness.

  .. _The_Backtrace_Symbolizer_gnatsymbolize:

  Translating Code Addresses into Source Locations with ``gnatsymbolize``
  =======================================================================

  .. index:: ! gnatsymbolize

  ``gnatsymbolize`` is a program which translates addresses into
  their corresponding filename, line number, and function names.

  Running ``gnatsymbolize``
  -------------------------

  ::

       $ gnatsymbolize [ switches ] filename [ addresses ]

  For instance, consider the following Ada program:

     .. code-block:: ada

        package Pck is
           Global_Val : Integer := 0;
           procedure Call_Me_First;
        end Pck;

        with GNAT.IO; use GNAT.IO;
        with GNAT.Traceback; use GNAT.Traceback;
        with GNAT.Debug_Utilities;
        package body Pck is
           procedure Call_Me_Third is
              TB : Tracebacks_Array (1 .. 5);
              TB_len : Natural;
           begin
              Global_Val := Global_Val + 1;

              Call_Chain (TB, TB_Len);
              for K in 1 .. TB_Len loop
                 Put_Line (GNAT.Debug_Utilities.Image_C (TB (K)));
              end loop;
           end Call_Me_Third;

           procedure Call_Me_Second is
           begin
              Call_Me_Third;
           end Call_Me_Second;

           procedure Call_Me_First is
           begin
              Call_Me_Second;
           end Call_Me_First;
        end Pck;
        with Pck; use Pck;

        procedure Foo is
        begin
           Global_Val := 123;
           Call_Me_First;
        end Foo;

  This program, when built and run, prints a list of addresses which
  correspond to the traceback when inside function ``Call_Me_Third``.
  For instance, on x86_64 GNU/Linux:

    ::

       $ gnatmake -g -q foo.adb
       $ ./foo
       0x0000000000402561
       0x00000000004025EF
       0x00000000004025FB
       0x0000000000402611
       0x00000000004024C7

  ``gnatsymbolize`` can be used to translate those addresses into
  code locations as follow:

    ::

       $ gnatsymbolize foo 0x0000000000402561 0x00000000004025EF \
           0x00000000004025FB 0x0000000000402611 0x00000000004024C7
       Pck.Call_Me_Third at pck.adb:12
       Pck.Call_Me_Second at pck.adb:20
       Pck.Call_Me_First at pck.adb:25
       Foo at foo.adb:6
       Main at b~foo.adb:184

  Switches for ``gnatsymbolize``
  ------------------------------

  ``gnatsymbolize`` recognizes the following switches:

  .. index:: --help (gnatsymbolize)

  :switch:`--help`
    Display the program's usage, and then exit, disregarding all other
    options.

  :switch:`--cache`
    Read the symbolic information from the executable and cache them
    in memory in order to accelerate the translation of each address
    into a symbolic location.

    Depending on the size of the executable and the number of addresses
    to translate, this may not always make ``gnatsymbolize`` faster
    overall.

  :switch:`--dump`
    If :switch:`--cache` is used, dump the contents of the cache on
    Standard Output. Has no effect otherwise.

  :switch:`--count={N}`
    If specified, compute the symbolic traceback ``N`` times in a row.
    This option is mostly useful for measuring the performance of
    ``gnatsymbolize``, particularly in the case where the cache is
    being used.

  Requirements for Correct Operation
  ----------------------------------

  The translation is performed by reading the DWARF debugging
  information produced by the compiler for each unit. All units
  for which the translation is to be done must therefore be compiled
  such that DWARF debugging information is produced. In most cases,
  this is done by simply compiling with ``-g``.

  This program provides a functionality similar to ``addr2line``.
  It has fewer options to tailor its output, but has been designed
  to require fewer of the DWARF sections to be present in the
  executable. In particular, the following sections can be
  stripped from the executable without impact to ``gnatsymbolize``'s
  functionality:

    * ``.debug_str``
    * ``.debug_ranges``

   .. _Using_Project_Files_with_GNAT_Tools:

   Using Project Files with GNAT Tools
   ===================================

   This section describes how project files can be used in conjunction
   with a number of GNAT tools.
   For a comprehensive description of project files and the overall
   GNAT Project Manager facility, please refer to the
   *GNAT Project Manager* chapter in the
   *GPRbuild and GPR Companion Tools User's Guide*.

   .. index:: Project-aware tool

   If a tool can take a project file as an option and extract the needed
   information, such a tool is called a *project-aware* tool.

   .. _Switches_Related_to_Project_Files:

   Switches Related to Project Files
   ---------------------------------

   The following switches are used by the project-aware GNAT tools:

   :switch:`-P{project_file}`
      Indicates the name of the project file whose source files are to
      be processed. The exact set of sources depends on other options
      specified, see below.

   :switch:`-U`
      If a project file is supplied, say for project ``proj``,
      but no sources are specified for ``proj`` (either by a
      project attribute or through a tool option that provides a list
      of the files to be used), process all the source files
      from projects imported either directly or indirectly by ``proj``.
      Otherwise this option has no effect.

   :switch:`-U {source_file}`
      Similar to :switch:`-U`, but if no sources are specified then
      process only those source files for units in the closure of
      the Ada source contained in ``source_file``. Note that this option
      expects the source file name but not the Ada unit name as its
      parameter.

   :switch:`-X{name}={val}`
      Indicates that the external variable ``name`` in the project has the
      value ``val``. Has no effect if no project has been specified.

   :switch:`--subdirs={dir}`
      Use the ``dir`` subdirectory of the project's object directory (or the ``dir``
      subdirectory of the project file directory if the project does not specify
      an object directory) for tool output files. Has no effect if no project
      has been specified or if :switch:`--no-objects-dir` is specified.

   :switch:`--no-objects-dir`
      Place all the result files into the current directory (i.e., the directory
      from which the tool invocation command is issued) instead of the project's
      object directory. Has no effect if no project has been specified.

   :switch:`-eL`
      Follow all symbolic links when processing project files.

   If a project file is specified and there is neither a :switch:`-U` option,
   nor a :switch:`-U {main_unit}` option, nor some other explicit option to
   specify the source files, then the sources to be processed are the
   immediate sources of the specified project (i.e., the source files directly
   defined by that project, either implicitly by residing in the project
   source directories, or explicitly through any of the source-related
   attributes).

   .. _Tool-specific_packages_in_project files:

   Tool-specific packages in project files
   ---------------------------------------

   Each project-aware tool may have a corresponding package in a project file;
   the package names are given elsewhere in this manual, in the sections that describe
   the respective tools.

   A tool-specific package in a project file may define the ``Default_Switches``
   attribute indexed by "ada" (as language name). The value of this attribute
   is a list of switches that will be supplied at tool invocation.
   Project-specific switches cannot be specified through this attribute.
